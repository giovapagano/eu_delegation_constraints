(2) Equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the Union. The second subparagraph of Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) provides that the Union is to promote equality between women and men. Similarly, Article 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter) requires equality between men and women to be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay. (3) Article 33 of the Charter provides for the right to protection from dismissal for a reason connected with maternity and the right to paid maternity leave and to parental leave following the birth or adoption of a child, to reconcile family and professional life. (4) The Union has ratified the 2006 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. That Convention is thus an integral part of the Union legal order, and Union legal acts must, as far as possible, be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Convention. The Convention provides, in particular in Article 7(1), that parties thereto are to take all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children. (5) The Member States have ratified the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 18(1) of the Convention provides that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child and that the best interests of the child should be the parents' basic concern. (6) Work-life balance policies should contribute to the achievement of gender equality by promoting the participation of women in the labour market, the equal sharing of caring responsibilities between men and women, and the closing of the gender gaps in earnings and pay. Such policies should take into account demographic changes including the effects of an ageing population. (7) In light of the challenges that arise from demographic change, together with the resultant pressure on public expenditure in some Member States, the need for informal care is expected to increase. (8) At Union level, several directives in the areas of gender equality and working conditions already address certain issues that are relevant for work-life balance, in particular Directives 2006/54/EC (4) and 2010/41/EU (5) of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Council Directives 92/85/EEC (6), 97/81/EC (7) and 2010/18/EU (8). (9) The principles of gender equality and work-life balance are reaffirmed in Principles 2 and 9 of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which was proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 17 November 2017. (10) However, work-life balance remains a considerable challenge for many parents and workers with caring responsibilities, in particular because of the increasing prevalence of extended working hours and changing work schedules, which has a negative impact on women's employment. A major factor contributing to the underrepresentation of women in the labour market is the difficulty of balancing work and family obligations. When they have children, women are likely to work fewer hours in paid employment and to spend more time fulfilling unpaid caring responsibilities. Having a sick or dependent relative has also been shown to have a negative impact on women's employment and results in some women dropping out of the labour market entirely. (11) The current Union legal framework provides limited incentives for men to assume an equal share of caring responsibilities. The lack of paid paternity and parental leave in many Member States contributes to the low take-up of leave by fathers. The imbalance in the design of work-life balance policies between women and men reinforces gender stereotypes and differences between work and care. Policies on equal treatment should aim to address the issue of stereotypes in both men's and women's occupations and roles, and the social partners are encouraged to act upon their key role in informing both workers and employers and raising their awareness of tackling discrimination. Furthermore, the use of work-life balance arrangements by fathers, such as leave or flexible working arrangements, has been shown to have a positive impact in reducing the relative amount of unpaid family work undertaken by women and leaving them more time for paid employment. (12) In implementing this Directive, Member States should take into consideration that the equal uptake of family-related leave between men and women also depends on other appropriate measures, such as the provision of accessible and affordable childcare and long-term care services, which are crucial for the purpose of allowing parents, and other persons with caring responsibilities to enter, remain in, or return to the labour market. Removing economic disincentives can also encourage second earners, the majority of whom are women, to participate fully in the labour market. (13) In order to assess the impact of this Directive, the Commission and the Member States should continue to cooperate with one another in order to develop comparable statistics that are disaggregated by sex. (14) The Commission has consulted management and labour in a two-stage process with regard to challenges related to work-life balance, in accordance with Article 154 TFEU. There was no agreement among the social partners to enter into negotiations with regard to those matters, including with regard to parental leave. It is, however, important to take action in that area by modernising and adapting the current legal framework, taking into account the outcome of those consultations, as well as of the public consultation carried out to seek the views of stakeholders and citizens. (15) Directive 2010/18/EU regulates parental leave by putting into effect a framework agreement concluded between the social partners. This Directive builds on the rules laid down in Directive 2010/18/EU and complements them by strengthening existing rights and by introducing new rights. Directive 2010/18/EU should be repealed and replaced by this Directive. (16) This Directive lays down minimum requirements related to paternity leave, parental leave and carers' leave, and to flexible working arrangements for workers who are parents, or carers. By facilitating the reconciliation of work and family life for such parents and carers, this Directive should contribute to the Treaty-based goals of equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities, equal treatment at work and the promotion of a high level of employment in the Union. (17) This Directive applies to all workers who have employment contracts or other employment relationships, including contracts relating to the employment or the employment relationships of part-time workers, fixed-term contract workers or persons with a contract of employment or employment relationship with a temporary agency, as previously provided for by Directive 2010/18/EU. Taking into account the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice) regarding the criteria for determining the status of a worker, it is for Member States to define employment contracts and employment relationships. (18) Member States have the competence to define marital and family status, as well as to establish which persons are to be considered to be a parent, a mother and a father. (19) In order to encourage a more equal sharing of caring responsibilities between women and men, and to allow for the early creation of a bond between fathers and children, a right to paternity leave for fathers or, where and insofar as recognised by national law, for equivalent second parents, should be introduced. Such paternity leave should be taken around the time of the birth of the child and should be clearly linked to the birth for the purposes of providing care. Member States are also able to grant paternity leave in the case of a stillbirth. It is for Member States to determine whether to allow part of the paternity leave to be taken before the birth of the child or to require all of it to be taken thereafter, the time frame within which paternity leave is to be taken, and whether and under which conditions to allow paternity leave to be taken on a part-time basis, in alternating periods, such as for a number of consecutive days of leave separated by periods of work, or in other flexible ways. Member States are able to specify whether paternity leave is expressed in working days, weeks or other time units, taking into account that ten working days correspond to two calendar weeks. In order to take account of differences between Member States, the right to paternity leave should be granted irrespective of marital or family status, as defined by national law. (20) As most fathers do not avail themselves of their right to parental leave, or transfer a considerable proportion of their leave entitlement to mothers, this Directive extends from one to two months the minimum period of parental leave which cannot be transferred from one parent to the other in order to encourage fathers to take parental leave, while maintaining the right of each parent to take at least four months of parental leave as provided for in Directive 2010/18/EU. The purpose of ensuring that at least two months of parental leave is available to each parent exclusively and that cannot be transferred to the other parent, is to encourage fathers to make use of their right to such leave. It also promotes and facilitates the reintegration of mothers in the labour market after they have taken a period of maternity and parental leave. (21) A minimum period of four months of parental leave is guaranteed under this Directive to workers who are parents. Member States are encouraged to grant the right to parental leave to all workers who exercise parental responsibilities in accordance with national legal systems. (22) Member States should be able to specify the period of notice to be given by the worker to the employer when applying for parental leave and should be able to decide whether the right to parental leave is subject to a certain period of service. In view of the growing diversity of contractual arrangements, the sum of successive fixed-term contracts with the same employer should be taken into account for the purpose of calculating such a period of service. To balance the needs of workers with those of employers, Member States should also be able to decide whether to allow employers to postpone the granting of parental leave under certain circumstances, subject to the requirement that the employers should provide reasons for such a postponement in writing. (23) Given that flexibility makes it more likely that each parent, in particular fathers, will take up their entitlement to parental leave, workers should be able to request that parental leave be granted on a full-time or a part-time basis, in alternating periods, such as for a number of consecutive weeks of leave separated by periods of work, or in other flexible ways. The employer should be able to accept or refuse such a request for parental leave in ways other than on a full-time basis. Member States should assess whether the conditions of access to and the detailed arrangements for parental leave should be adapted to the specific needs of parents in particularly disadvantaged situations. (24) The period within which workers should be entitled to take parental leave should be linked to the age of the child. That age should be set in such a way as to enable both parents to effectively take up their full entitlement to parental leave under this Directive. (25) In order to facilitate the return to work following a period of parental leave, workers and employers are encouraged to maintain voluntary contact during the period of leave and can make arrangements for any appropriate measures to facilitate reintegration into the work place. Such contact and arrangements are to be decided between the parties concerned, taking into account national law, collective agreements or practice. Workers should be informed of promotion processes and internal vacancies and should be able to participate in such processes and to apply for such vacancies. (26) Studies demonstrate that Member States that provide a significant portion of parental leave to fathers and that pay the worker a payment or allowance during that leave at a relatively high replacement rate, experience a higher take-up rate by fathers and a positive trend in the rate of employment of mothers. It is therefore appropriate to allow such systems to continue provided that they meet certain minimum criteria, instead of providing the payment or allowance for paternity leave as provided for in this Directive. (27) In order to provide men and women with caring responsibilities with greater opportunities to remain in the workforce, each worker should have the right to carers' leave of five working days per year. Member States may decide that such leave can be taken in periods of one or more working days per case. In order to take account of divergent national systems, Member States should be able to allocate carers' leave on the basis of a period other than a year, by reference to the person in need of care or support, or by case. A continued rise in care needs is predicted, because of an ageing population and, consequentially, the concomitant increase in the prevalence of age-related impairments. The rise in care needs should be taken into account by Member States when they develop their care policies, including with regard to carers' leave. Member States are encouraged to make the right to carers' leave available with regard to additional relatives, such as grandparents and siblings. Member States can require prior medical certification of the need for significant care or support for a serious medical reason. (28) In addition to the right to carers' leave provided for in this Directive, all workers should retain their right to take time off from work without the loss of employment rights that have been acquired or that are in the process of being acquired, on the grounds of force majeure for urgent and unexpected family reasons, as provided for in Directive 2010/18/EU, in accordance with the conditions established by the Member States. (29) To increase incentives to workers who are parents, and to men in particular, to take the periods of leave provided for in this Directive, workers should be provided with a right to an adequate allowance while on leave. (30) Member States should therefore set a level for the payment or allowance with respect to the minimum period of paternity leave that is at least equivalent to the level of national sick pay. Since granting rights to paternity and maternity leave pursue similar objectives, namely creating a bond between the parent and the child, Member States are encouraged to provide for a payment or an allowance for paternity leave that is equal to the payment or allowance provided for maternity leave at national level. (31) Member States should set the payment or allowance for the minimum non-transferable period of parental leave guaranteed under this Directive at an adequate level. When setting the level of the payment or allowance provided for the minimum non-transferable period of parental leave, Member States should take into account that the take-up of parental leave often results in a loss of income for the family and that first earners in a family are able to make use of their right to parental leave only if it is sufficiently well remunerated, with a view to allowing for a decent living standard. (32) Although Member States are free to decide whether to provide a payment or an allowance for carers' leave, they are encouraged to introduce such a payment or an allowance in order to guarantee the effective take-up of the right by carers, in particular by men. (33) This Directive is without prejudice to the coordination of social security systems under Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 (9) and (EU) No 1231/2010 (10) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EC) No 859/2003 (11). The Member State competent for the social security of a worker is determined by those Regulations. (34) In order to encourage workers who are parents, and carers to remain in the work force, such workers should be able to adapt their working schedules to their personal needs and preferences. To that end and with a focus on workers' needs, they have the right to request flexible working arrangements for the purpose of adjusting their working patterns, including, where possible, through the use of remote working arrangements, flexible working schedules, or a reduction in working hours, for the purposes of providing care. (35) In order to address the needs of both workers and employers, it should be possible for Member States to limit the duration of flexible working arrangements, including any reduction in working hours or any remote working arrangements. While working part-time has been shown to be useful in allowing some women to remain in the labour market after having children or caring for relatives with care or support needs, long periods of reduced working hours can lead to lower social security contributions and thus reduced or non-existing pension entitlements. (36) When considering requests for flexible working arrangements, employers should be able to take into account, inter alia, the duration of the flexible working arrangements requested and the employers' resources and operational capacity to offer such arrangements. The employer should be able to decide whether to accept or refuse a worker's request for flexible working arrangements. Specific circumstances underlying the need for flexible working arrangements can change. Workers should therefore have the right not only to return to their original working pattern at the end of a mutually agreed period, but should also be able to request to do so earlier where required on the basis of a change in the underlying circumstances. (37) Notwithstanding the requirement to assess whether the conditions of access to and the detailed arrangements for parental leave should be adapted to the specific needs of parents in particularly disadvantaged situations, Member States are encouraged to assess whether conditions for access to, and the detailed arrangements for, exercising the right to paternity leave, carers' leave and flexible working arrangements should be adapted to particular needs, such as of those of single parents, adoptive parents, parents with a disability, parents of children with a disability or a long-term illness, or parents in particular circumstances, such as those related to multiple births and premature births. (38) Leave arrangements are intended to support workers who are parents, and carers during a specific period of time, and aim to maintain and promote the workers' continued attachment to the labour market. It is therefore appropriate to make express provision for the protection of the employment rights of workers who take the types of leave covered by this Directive. In particular, this Directive protects the right of workers to return to the same or to an an equivalent post after taking such leave and the right not to be subject to any detriment in the terms and conditions of their contract of employment or employment relationship as a result of taking such leave. Workers should retain their entitlement to relevant rights that are already acquired, or that are in the process of being acquired, until the end of such leave. (39) As provided for in Directive 2010/18/EU, Member States are required to define the status of the employment contract or employment relationship for the period of parental leave. According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the employment relationship between the worker and the employer is maintained during the period of leave and, as a result, the beneficiary of such leave remains, during that period, a worker for the purposes of Union law. When defining the status of the employment contract or employment relationship during the period of the types of leave covered by this Directive, including with regard to the entitlement to social security, the Member States should therefore ensure that the employment relationship is maintained. (40) Workers who exercise their right to take leave or to request flexible working arrangements as provided for in this Directive should be protected against discrimination or any less favourable treatment on that ground. (41) Workers who exercise their right to take leave or to request flexible working arrangements as provided for in this Directive should enjoy protection from dismissal and any preparatory steps for a possible dismissal on the grounds that they have applied for, or have taken, such leave or that they have exercised their right to request such flexible working arrangements in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice, including its judgment in Case C-460/06 (12). Workers who consider that they have been dismissed on the basis that they have exercised such rights should be able to ask the employer to provide duly substantiated grounds for the dismissal. Where a worker has applied for, or has taken, paternity leave, parental leave or carers' leave as referred to in this Directive, the employer should provide the grounds for dismissal in writing. (42) The burden of proving that there has been no dismissal on the grounds that workers have applied for, or have taken, paternity leave, parental leave or carers' leave as referred to in this Directive should be on the employer where a worker has established, before a court or another competent authority, facts capable of giving rise to a presumption that the worker has been dismissed on such grounds. (43) Member States should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in the event of infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive or national provisions that are already in force on the date of entry into force of this Directive and that relate to the rights which are within its scope. Such penalties can include administrative and financial penalties, such as fines or the payment of compensation, as well as other types of penalties. (44) The effective implementation of the principles of equal treatment and equal opportunities requires the adequate judicial protection of workers against adverse treatment or adverse consequences resulting from a complaint or from proceedings relating to the rights under this Directive. It is possible that victims are deterred from exercising their rights on account of the risk of retaliation and therefore should be protected from any adverse treatment where they exercise their rights provided for in this Directive. Such protection is particularly relevant as regards the representatives of workers in the exercise of their functions. (45) With a view to further improving the level of protection of the rights provided for in this Directive, national equality bodies should be competent in regard to issues relating to discrimination that fall within the scope of this Directive, including the task of providing independent assistance to victims of discrimination in pursuing their complaints. (46) This Directive lays down minimum requirements, thus giving the Member States the option of introducing or maintaining provisions that are more favourable to workers. Allowing one parent to transfer to the other parent more than two months out of the four months of parental leave provided for in this Directive does not constitute a provision that is more favourable to the worker than the minimum provisions laid down in this Directive. Rights that are already acquired on the date of entry into force of this Directive should continue to apply unless this Directive provides for more favourable provisions. The implementation of this Directive should neither be used to reduce existing Union law rights, nor constitute valid grounds for reducing the general level of protection provided to workers, in the areas covered by this Directive. (47) In particular, nothing in this Directive should be interpreted as reducing the rights provided for in Directives 2010/18/EU, 92/85/EEC and 2006/54/EC, including Article 19 of Directive 2006/54/EC. (48) Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as defined in the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (13), which represent the large majority of enterprises in the Union, can have limited financial, technical and human resources. In implementing this Directive, Member States should strive to avoid imposing administrative, financial or legal constraints in a manner which would amount to a disincentive to the creation and development of SMEs or an excessive burden to employers. Member States are therefore invited to thoroughly assess the impact of their implementing measures on SMEs in order to ensure the equal treatment of all workers, that SMEs are not disproportionately affected by the measures, with particular focus on microenterprises, and that any unnecessary administrative burden is avoided. Member States are encouraged to provide incentives, guidance and advice to SMEs to assist them in complying with their obligations pursuant to this Directive. (49) Any kind of family-related time off work, in particular maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave and carers' leave, that is available under national law or collective agreements should count towards fulfilling the requirements of one or more of the types of leave provided for in this Directive and in Directive 92/85/EEC, provided that the minimum requirements of those directives are fulfilled and that the general level of protection provided to workers in the areas covered by them is not reduced. In implementing this Directive, Member States are not required to rename or otherwise change the different types of family-related leave that are provided for under national law or collective agreements and which count towards compliance with this Directive. (50) Member States are encouraged, in accordance with national practice, to promote a social dialogue with the social partners with a view to fostering the reconciliation of work and private life, including by promoting work-life balance measures in the workplace, establishing voluntary certification systems, providing vocational training, raising awareness, and carrying out information campaigns. In addition, Member States are encouraged to engage in a dialogue with relevant stakeholders, such as non-governmental organisations, local and regional authorities and service providers, in order to promote work-life balance policies in accordance with national law and practice. (51) The social partners should be encouraged to promote voluntary certification systems assessing work-life balance at the workplace. (52) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to ensure the implementation of the principle of equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work across the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Subject matter This Directive lays down minimum requirements designed to achieve equality between men and women with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work, by facilitating the reconciliation of work and family life for workers who are parents, or carers. To that end, this Directive provides for individual rights related to the following: (a) paternity leave, parental leave and carers' leave; (b) flexible working arrangements for workers who are parents, or carers. Article 2 Scope This Directive applies to all workers, men and women, who have an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by the law, collective agreements or practice in force in each Member State, taking into account the case-law of the Court of Justice. Article 3 Definitions 1. For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (a) paternity leave means leave from work for fathers or, where and insofar as recognised by national law, for equivalent second parents, on the occasion of the birth of a child for the purposes of providing care; (b) parental leave means leave from work for parents on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child to take care of that child; (c) carers' leave means leave from work for workers in order to provide personal care or support to a relative, or to a person who lives in the same household as the worker, and who is in need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason, as defined by each Member State; (d) carer means a worker providing personal care or support to a relative, or to a person who lives in the same household as the worker, and who is in need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason, as defined by each Member State; (e) relative means a worker's son, daughter, mother, father, spouse or, where such partnerships are recognised by national law, partner in civil partnership; (f) flexible working arrangements means the possibility for workers to adjust their working patterns, including through the use of remote working arrangements, flexible working schedules, or reduced working hours. 2. The reference to working days in Articles 4 and 6 shall be understood as referring to the full-time working pattern, as defined in the Member State in question. A worker's entitlement to leave may be calculated proportionally to the worker's working time, in accordance with the working pattern specified in the worker's contract of employment or employment relationship. Article 4 Paternity leave 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that fathers or, where and insofar as recognised by national law, equivalent second parents, have the right to paternity leave of 10 working days that is to be taken on the occasion of the birth of the worker's child. Member States may determine whether to allow paternity leave to be taken partly before or only after the birth of the child and whether to allow such leave to be taken in flexible ways. 2. The right to paternity leave shall not be made subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification. 3. The right to paternity leave shall be granted irrespective of the worker's marital or family status, as defined by national law. Article 5 Parental leave 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that each worker has an individual right to parental leave of four months that is to be taken before the child reaches a specified age, up to the age of eight, to be specified by each Member State or by collective agreement. That age shall be determined with a view to ensuring that each parent is able to exercise their right to parental leave effectively and on an equal basis. 2. Member States shall ensure that two months of parental leave cannot be transferred. 3. Member States shall establish a reasonable period of notice that is to be given by workers to employers where they exercise their right to parental leave. In doing so, Member States shall take into account the needs of both the employers and the workers. Member States shall ensure that the worker's request for parental leave specifies the intended beginning and end of the period of leave. 4. Member States may make the right to parental leave subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification, which shall not exceed one year. In the case of successive fixed-term contracts within the meaning of Council Directive 1999/70/EC (14) with the same employer, the sum of those contracts shall be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the qualifying period. 5. Member States may establish the circumstances in which an employer, following consultation in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practice, is allowed to postpone the granting of parental leave for a reasonable period of time on the grounds that the taking of parental leave at the time requested would seriously disrupt the good functioning of the employer. Employers shall provide reasons for such a postponement of parental leave in writing. 6. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that workers have the right to request that they take parental leave in flexible ways. Member States may specify the modalities of application thereof. The employer shall consider and respond to such requests, taking into account the needs of both the employer and the worker. The employer shall provide reasons for any refusal to accede to such a request in writing within a reasonable period after the request. 7. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that when considering requests for full-time parental leave, employers shall, prior to any postponement in accordance with paragraph 5, offer, to the extent possible, flexible ways of taking parental leave pursuant to paragraph 6. 8. Member States shall assess the need for the conditions of access to and the detailed arrangements for the application of parental leave to be adapted to the needs of adoptive parents, parents with a disability and parents with children with a disability or a long-term illness. Article 6 Carers' leave 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that each worker has the right to carers' leave of five working days per year. Member States may determine additional details regarding the scope and conditions of carers' leave in accordance with national law or practice. The use of that right may be subject to appropriate substantiation, in accordance with national law or practice. 2. Member States may allocate carers' leave on the basis of a reference period other than a year, per person in need of care or support, or per case. Article 7 Time off from work on grounds of force majeure Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that each worker has the right to time off from work on grounds of force majeure for urgent family reasons in the case of illness or accident making the immediate attendance of the worker indispensable. Member States may limit the right of each worker to time off from work on grounds of force majeure to a certain amount of time each year or by case, or both. Article 8 Payment or allowance 1. In accordance with national circumstances, such as national law, collective agreements or practice, and taking into account the powers delegated to the social partners, Member States shall ensure that workers who exercise their right to leave provided for in Article 4(1) or Article 5(2) receive a payment or an allowance in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article. 2. With regard to paternity leave as referred to in Article 4(1), such payment or allowance shall guarantee an income at least equivalent to that which the worker concerned would receive in the event of a break in the worker's activities on grounds connected with the worker's state of health, subject to any ceiling laid down in national law. Member States may make the right to a payment or an allowance subject to periods of previous employment, which shall not exceed six months immediately prior to the expected date of the birth of the child. 3. With regard to parental leave as referred to in Article 5(2), such payment or allowance shall be defined by the Member State or the social partners and shall be set in such a way as to facilitate the take-up of parental leave by both parents. Article 9 Flexible working arrangements 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that workers with children up to a specified age, which shall be at least eight years, and carers, have the right to request flexible working arrangements for caring purposes. The duration of such flexible working arrangements may be subject to a reasonable limitation. 2. Employers shall consider and respond to requests for flexible working arrangements as referred to in paragraph 1 within a reasonable period of time, taking into account the needs of both the employer and the worker. Employers shall provide reasons for any refusal of such a request or for any postponement of such arrangements. 3. When flexible working arrangements as referred to in paragraph 1 are limited in duration, the worker shall have the right to return to the original working pattern at the end of the agreed period. The worker shall also have the right to request to return to the original working pattern before the end of the agreed period where justified on the basis of a change of circumstances. The employer shall consider and respond to a request for an early return to the original working pattern, taking into account the needs of both the employer and the worker. 4. Member States may make the right to request flexible working arrangements subject to a period of work qualification or to a length of service qualification, which shall not exceed six months. In the case of successive fixed-term contracts within the meaning of Directive 1999/70/EC with the same employer, the sum of those contracts shall be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the qualifying period. Article 10 Employment rights 1. Rights that have been acquired or that are in the process of being acquired by workers on the date on which leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6 or time off from work provided for in Article 7 starts shall be maintained until the end of such leave or time off from work. At the end of such leave or time off from work, those rights, including any changes arising from national law, collective agreements or practice, shall apply. 2. Member States shall ensure that, at the end of leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6, workers are entitled to return to their jobs or to equivalent posts on terms and conditions which are no less favourable to them, and to benefit from any improvement in working conditions to which they would have been entitled had they not taken the leave. 3. Member States shall define the status of the employment contract or employment relationship for the period of leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6, or time off from work provided for in Article 7, including as regards entitlements to social security, including pension contributions, while ensuring that the employment relationship is maintained during that period. Article 11 Discrimination Member States shall take the necessary measures to prohibit less favourable treatment of workers on the ground that they have applied for, or have taken, leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6 or time off from work provided for in Article 7, or that they have exercised the rights provided for in Article 9. Article 12 Protection from dismissal and burden of proof 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the dismissal and all preparations for the dismissal of workers, on the grounds that they have applied for, or have taken, leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6, or have exercised the right to request flexible working arrangements referred to in Article 9. 2. Workers who consider that they have been dismissed on the grounds that they have applied for, or have taken, leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6, or have exercised the right to request flexible working arrangements as referred to in Article 9, may request the employer to provide duly substantiated reasons for their dismissal. With respect to the dismissal of a worker who has applied for, or has taken, leave provided for in Article 4, 5 or 6, the employer shall provide reasons for the dismissal in writing. 3. Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that where workers who consider that they have been dismissed on the grounds that they have applied for, or have taken, leave provided for in Articles 4, 5 and 6 establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts capable of giving rise to a presumption that they have been dismissed on such grounds, it shall be for the employer to prove that the dismissal was based on other grounds. 4. Paragraph 3 shall not prevent Member States from introducing rules of evidence which are more favourable to workers. 5. Member States shall not be required to apply paragraph 3 to proceedings in which it is for the court or competent body to investigate the facts of the case. 6. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to criminal proceedings, unless otherwise provided by the Member States. Article 13 Penalties Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, or the relevant provisions already in force concerning the rights which are within the scope of this Directive, and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Article 14 Protection against adverse treatment or consequences Member States shall introduce measures necessary to protect workers, including workers who are employees' representatives, from any adverse treatment by the employer or adverse consequences resulting from a complaint lodged within the undertaking or any legal proceedings for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the requirements laid down in this Directive. Article 15 Equality bodies Without prejudice to the competence of labour inspectorates or other bodies that enforce the rights of workers, including the social partners, Member States shall ensure that the body or bodies designated, pursuant to Article 20 of Directive 2006/54/EC, for the promotion, analysis, monitoring and support of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on grounds of sex, are competent with regard to issues relating to discrimination falling within the scope of this Directive. Article 16 Level of protection 1. Member States may introduce or maintain provisions that are more favourable to workers than those laid down in this Directive. 2. The implementation of this Directive shall not constitute grounds for justifying a reduction in the general level of protection of workers in the areas covered by this Directive. The prohibition of such a reduction in the level of protection shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States and the social partners to lay down, in light of changing circumstances, legislative, regulatory or contractual arrangements other than those in force on 1 August 2019, provided that the minimum requirements laid down in this Directive are complied with. Article 17 Dissemination of information Member States shall ensure that the national measures transposing this Directive, together with the relevant provisions already in force relating to the subject matter as set out in Article 1, are brought to the attention of workers and employers, including employers that are SMEs, by all appropriate means throughout their territory. Article 18 Reporting and review 1. By 2 August 2027, Member States shall communicate to the Commission all information concerning the implementation of this Directive that is necessary for the Commission to draw up a report. That information shall include available aggregated data on the take-up of different types of leave and flexible working arrangements, by men and women pursuant to this Directive, for the purposes of allowing the proper monitoring and assessment of the implementation of this Directive, in particular with regard to gender equality. 2. The Commission shall submit the report referred to in paragraph 1 to the European Parliament and to the Council. The report shall, if appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal. The report shall also be accompanied by: (a) a study of the interaction between the different types of leave provided for in this Directive as well as other types of family-related leave, such as adoption leave; and (b) a study of the rights to family-related leave that are granted to self-employed persons. Article 19 Repeal 1. Directive 2010/18/EU is repealed with effect from 2 August 2022. References to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table set out in the Annex. 2 Notwithstanding the repeal of Directive 2010/18/EU pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, any period or separate cumulative periods of parental leave taken or transferred by a worker pursuant to that Directive before 2 August 2022 may be deducted from that worker's parental leave entitlement under Article 5 of this Directive. Article 20 Transposition 1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 2 August 2022. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, for the payment or allowance corresponding to the last two weeks of parental leave as provided for in Article 8(3), Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 2 August 2024. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. 3. When Member States adopt the measures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States. 4. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main measures of national law which they adopt in the areas covered by this Directive. 5. The detailed rules and modalities for applying this Directive shall be established in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practice, as long as the minimum requirements and the objectives of this Directive are respected. 6. For the purposes of complying with Articles 4, 5, 6 and 8 of this Directive and with Directive 92/85/EEC, Member States may take into account any period of, and payment or allowance with respect to, family-related time off work, in particular maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave and carers' leave, available at national level which is above the minimum standards provided for in this Directive or in Directive 92/85/EEC, provided that the minimum requirements for such leave are met and that the general level of protection provided to workers in the areas covered by those Directives is not reduced. 7. Where Member States ensure a payment or an allowance of at least 65 % of the worker's net wage, which may be subject to a ceiling, for at least six months of parental leave for each parent, they may decide to maintain such system rather than provide for the payment or allowance referred to in Article 8(2). 8. Member States may entrust the social partners with the implementation of this Directive, where the social partners jointly request to do so, provided that Member States take all the necessary steps to ensure that the results sought by this Directive are guaranteed at all times.

(2) In order to enhance security, improve prosecution of financial crimes, combat money laundering and prevent tax crimes in the Member States and across the Union, it is necessary to improve access to information by Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and public authorities responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious crime, to enhance their ability to conduct financial investigations and to improve cooperation between them. (3) Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union and the Member States are to assist each other. They should also commit to cooperate in a loyal and expeditious manner. (4) In its communication of 2 February 2016 on an Action Plan to strengthen the fight against terrorist financing, the Commission committed to explore the possibility of a distinct self-standing legal instrument to broaden the access to centralised bank and payment account registers by Member States authorities, including by authorities competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, by Asset Recovery Offices, by tax authorities and by anti-corruption authorities. Moreover, that Action Plan also called for a mapping of obstacles to the access to, exchange and use of information as well as to operational cooperation between FIUs. (5) Combating serious crime, including financial fraud and money laundering, remains a priority for the Union. (6) Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) requires Member States to put in place centralised bank account registries or data retrieval systems allowing the timely identification of the persons holding bank and payment accounts and safe-deposit boxes. (7) Pursuant to Directive (EU) 2015/849, the information held in such centralised bank account registries is to be directly accessible to FIUs and also accessible to national authorities competent for the prevention of money laundering, the associated predicate offences and terrorist financing. (8) Immediate and direct access to the information held in centralised bank account registries is often indispensable for the success of a criminal investigation or for the timely identification, tracing and freezing of related assets in view of their confiscation. Direct access is the most immediate type of access to the information held in centralised bank account registries. This Directive should therefore lay down rules granting direct access to information held in centralised bank account registries to designated Member States authorities competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences. Where a Member State provides access to bank account information through a central electronic data retrieval system, that Member State should ensure that the authority operating the retrieval system reports search results in an immediate and unfiltered way to the designated competent authorities. This Directive should not affect channels for exchanging information between competent authorities or their powers to obtain information from obliged entities, under Union or national law. Any access to information held in centralised registries by the national authorities for purposes other than those of this Directive or with respect to criminal offences other than those covered by this Directive falls outside the scope thereof. (9) Given that in each Member State there are numerous authorities or bodies which are competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and in order to ensure proportionate access to financial and other information under this Directive, Member States should be required to designate which authorities or bodies are empowered to have access to the centralised bank account registries and which are able to request information from FIUs for the purposes of this Directive. When implementing this Directive, Member States should take into account the nature, organisational status, tasks and prerogatives of such authorities and bodies as established by their national law, including existing mechanisms for the protection of financial systems against money laundering and terrorist financing. (10) Asset Recovery Offices should be designated from amongst the competent authorities and have direct access to the information held in centralised bank account registries when preventing, detecting or investigating a specific serious criminal offence or supporting a specific criminal investigation, including the identification, tracing and freezing of assets. (11) To the extent that tax authorities and anti-corruption agencies are competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences under national law, they should also be considered authorities that can be designated for the purposes of this Directive. Administrative investigations other than those conducted by the FIUs in the context of preventing, detecting and effectively combatting money laundering and terrorist financing should not be covered by this Directive. (12) The perpetrators of criminal offences, in particular criminal groups and terrorists, often operate across different Member States and their assets, including bank accounts, are often located in other Member States. Given the cross-border dimension of serious crimes, including terrorism, and of the related financial activities, it is often necessary for competent authorities carrying out criminal investigations in one Member State to access information on bank accounts held in other Member States. (13) The information acquired by competent authorities from national centralised bank account registries can be exchanged with competent authorities located in another Member State, in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA (4), Directive 2014/41/EU of the European Parliament and the Council (5) and with applicable data protection rules. (14) Directive (EU) 2015/849 has substantially enhanced the Union legal framework that governs the activity and cooperation of FIUs, including the assessment by the Commission of the possibility of establishing a coordination and support mechanism. The legal status of FIUs varies across Member States from an administrative or a law enforcement status to hybrid ones. The powers of FIUs include the right to access the financial, administrative and law enforcement information that they require to prevent, detect and combat money laundering, the associated predicate offences and terrorist financing. Nevertheless, Union law does not lay down all specific tools and mechanisms that FIUs should have at their disposal in order to access such information and accomplish their tasks. Since Member States are entirely responsible for setting up and deciding on the organisational nature of FIUs, different FIUs have varying degrees of access to regulatory databases, which leads to an insufficient exchange of information between law enforcement or prosecution services and FIUs. (15) In order to enhance legal certainty and operational effectiveness, this Directive should lay down rules to strengthen the FIUs ability to share financial information and financial analysis with the designated competent authorities in their Member State for all serious criminal offences. More precisely, FIUs should be required to cooperate with the designated competent authorities of their Member States and be able to reply, in a timely manner, to reasoned requests for financial information or financial analysis by those designated competent authorities, where that financial information or financial analysis is necessary, on a case-by-case basis and when such requests are motivated by concerns relating to the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious criminal offences, subject to the exemptions provided for in Article 32(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849. That requirement should not preclude the autonomy of the FIUs under Directive (EU) 2015/849. In particular, in cases where the information requested originates from the FIU of another Member State, any restrictions and conditions imposed by that FIU for the use of that information should be complied with. Any use for purposes beyond those originally approved should be made subject to the prior consent of that FIU. FIUs should appropriately explain any refusal to reply to a request for information or analysis. This Directive should not affect the operational independence and autonomy of the FIUs under Directive (EU) 2015/849, including the autonomy of the FIUs to spontaneously disseminate information on their own initiative for the purposes of this Directive. (16) This Directive should also set out a clearly defined legal framework to enable FIUs to request relevant data stored by designated competent authorities in their Member State in order to enable them to prevent, detect and combat money laundering, the associated predicate offences and terrorist financing effectively. (17) FIUs should endeavour to exchange financial information or financial analysis promptly in exceptional and urgent cases, where such information or analysis is related to terrorism or organised crime associated with terrorism. (18) Such exchange should not hamper a FIUs active role under Directive (EU) 2015/849 in disseminating its analysis to other FIUs where that analysis reveals facts, conduct or suspicion of money laundering and terrorist financing of direct interest to those other FIUs. Financial analysis covers operational analysis which focuses on individual cases and specific targets or on appropriate selected information, depending on the type and volume of the disclosures received and the expected use of the information after dissemination, as well as strategic analysis addressing money laundering and terrorist financing trends and patterns. However, this Directive should be without prejudice to the organisational status and role conferred to FIUs under the national law of Member States. (19) Given the sensitivity of financial data that should be analysed by FIUs and the necessary data protection safeguards, this Directive should specifically set out the type and scope of information that can be exchanged between FIUs, between FIUs and designated competent authorities and between designated competent authorities of different Member States. This Directive should not change currently agreed methods of data collection. However, Member States should be able to decide to broaden the scope of financial information and bank account information that can be exchanged between the FIUs and designated competent authorities. Member States should also be able to facilitate access by designated competent authorities to financial information and bank account information for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences other than serious criminal offences. This Directive should not derogate from the applicable data protection rules. (20) Under the specific competences and tasks of the Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) established by Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), as laid down in that Regulation, Europol provides support to cross-border investigations by Member States into the money laundering activities of transnational criminal organisations. In that context, Europol should notify the Member States of any information and connections between criminal offences concerning those Member States. According to that Regulation, the Europol national units are the liaison bodies between Europol and the Member States authorities that are competent to investigate criminal offences. To provide Europol with the information necessary to carry out its tasks, each Member State should allow its FIU to reply to requests for financial information and financial analysis made by Europol through the Europol national unit of that Member State or, where appropriate, by direct contacts. Member States should also provide that their Europol national unit and, where appropriate, their designated competent authorities, are entitled to reply to requests for information on bank accounts by Europol. Requests made by Europol should be duly justified. They should be made on a case-by case basis, within the limits of Europols responsibilities and for the performance of its tasks. The operational independence and autonomy of FIUs should not be jeopardised and the decision whether to provide the requested information or analysis should remain with the FIUs. In order to ensure quick and effective cooperation, FIUs should reply to requests by Europol in a timely manner. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/794, Europol should continue its current practice of providing feedback to the Member States about the use made of the information or analysis provided under this Directive. (21) This Directive should also take into consideration the fact that, where applicable, in accordance with Article 43 of Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 (7), the European Delegated Prosecutors of the European Public Prosecution Office (EPPO) are empowered to obtain any relevant information stored in national criminal investigation and law enforcement databases, as well as other relevant registers of public authorities, including centralised bank account registries and data retrieval systems, under the same conditions as those that apply under national law in similar cases. (22) To strengthen the cooperation between FIUs, the Commission should carry out an impact assessment in the near future to evaluate the possibility and appropriateness of establishing a coordination and support mechanism, such as an EU FIU. (23) To achieve the appropriate balance between efficiency and a high level of data protection, Member States should be required to ensure that the processing of sensitive financial information that could reveal sensitive data concerning a persons racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or of data concerning a natural persons health, sex life or sexual orientation should be allowed only by specifically authorised persons and in accordance with the applicable data protection rules. (24) This Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6 TEU and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to respect for ones private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, the prohibition of discrimination, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and the right of defence and the principles of the legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, as well as the fundamental rights and principles provided for in international law and international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States are party, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in Member States constitutions, in their respective fields of application. (25) It is essential to ensure that processing of personal data under this Directive fully respects the right to protection of personal data. Any such processing is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (8) and to Directive (EU) 2016/680 (9) of the European Parliament and of the Council, in their respective scope of application. As far as the access of Asset Recovery Offices to centralised bank account registries and data retrieval systems is concerned, Directive (EU) 2016/680 applies while Article 5(2) of Council Decision 2007/845/JHA (10) does not apply. As far as Europol is concerned, Regulation (EU) 2016/794 applies. Specific and additional safeguards and conditions for ensuring the protection of personal data should be laid down in this Directive in respect of mechanisms to ensure the processing of sensitive data and records of information requests. (26) Any personal data obtained under this Directive should only be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection rules by competent authorities where it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious crime. (27) Furthermore, in order to respect the right to the protection of personal data and the right to privacy, and to limit the impact of access to the information contained in centralised bank account registries and data retrieval systems, it is essential to provide for conditions limiting such access. In particular, Member States should ensure that appropriate data protection policies and measures apply to access to personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of this Directive. Only authorised staff should have access to information containing personal data which can be obtained from the centralised bank account registries or through authentication processes. Staff granted access to such sensitive data should receive training on security practices with regard to the exchange and handling of the data. (28) The transfer of financial data to third countries and international partners for the purposes of this Directive should only be allowed under the conditions laid down in Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Chapter V of Directive (EU) 2016/680. (29) The Commission should report on the implementation of this Directive three years after its date of transposition, and every three years thereafter. In accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (11) the Commission should also carry out an evaluation of this Directive on the basis of information collected through specific monitoring arrangements in order to assess the actual effects of the Directive and the need for any further action. (30) This Directive aims to ensure that rules are adopted to provide Union citizens with a higher level of security by preventing and combating crime, pursuant to Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Due to their transnational nature, terrorist and criminal threats affect the Union as a whole and require a Union-wide response. Criminals could exploit, and would benefit from, the lack of an efficient use of bank account information and financial information in a Member State, which could in turn have consequences in another Member State. (31) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to improve access to information by FIUs and public authorities responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of serious crime, to enhance their ability to conduct financial investigations and to improve cooperation between them, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective. (32) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive regarding the authorisation of Member States to provisionally apply or to conclude agreements with third countries that are contracting parties of the European Economic Area, on matters falling within the scope of Chapter II of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). (33) Council Decision 2000/642/JHA should be repealed since its subject matter is regulated by other Union acts and it is no longer needed. (34) In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TF EU, United Kingdom and Ireland have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Directive. (35) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and is not bound by it or subject to its application. (36) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) and delivered an opinion on 10 September 2018, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter 1.

Where there are objective grounds for assuming that the provision of such information would have a negative impact on ongoing investigations or analyses, or, in exceptional circumstances, where disclosure of the information would be clearly disproportionate to the legitimate interests of a natural or legal person or irrelevant with regard to the purposes for which it has been requested, the FIU shall be under no obligation to comply with the request for information. 3. Any use for purposes beyond those originally approved shall be made subject to the prior consent of that FIU. FIUs shall appropriately explain any refusal to reply to a request made under paragraph 1. 4. The decision on conducting the dissemination of information shall remain with the FIU. 5. The designated competent authorities may process the financial information and financial analysis received from the FIU for the specific purposes of preventing, detecting, investigating or prosecuting serious criminal offences other than the purposes for which personal data are collected in accordance with Article 4(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/680.

Each Member State shall ensure that its designated competent authorities use the financial information or financial analysis exchanged pursuant to this Article only for the purpose for which it was sought or provided. Each Member State shall ensure that any dissemination of financial information or financial analysis obtained by its designated competent authorities from the FIU of that Member State to any other authority, agency or department or any use of that information for purposes other than those originally approved is made subject to the prior consent of the FIU providing the information. 2. Member States shall ensure that a request made pursuant to this Article and its response are transmitted using dedicated secure electronic communications ensuring a high level of data security. CHAPTER IV EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH EUROPOL Article 11 Provision of bank account information to Europol Each Member State shall ensure that its competent authorities are entitled to reply, through the Europol national unit or, if allowed by that Member State, by direct contacts with Europol, to duly justified requests related to bank account information made by Europol on a case-by-case basis within the limits of its responsibilities and for the performance of its tasks.

Each Member State shall ensure that its FIU is entitled to reply to duly justified requests made by Europol through the Europol national unit or, if allowed by that Member State, by direct contacts between the FIU and Europol. Such requests shall be related to financial information and financial analysis and made on a case-by-case basis within the limits of the responsibilities of Europol and for the performance of its tasks. 2. Article 32(5) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and Article 7(6) and (7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/794 apply to the exchanges made pursuant to this Article. 3. Member States shall ensure that any failure to comply with a request is appropriately explained. Article 13 Detailed arrangements for the exchange of information 1. Member States shall ensure that the exchanges of information pursuant to Articles 11 and 12 of this Directive take place in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/794 electronically through: (a) SIENA or its successor, in the language applicable to SIENA; or (b) where applicable, FIU.Net or its successor. 2. Member States shall ensure that the exchange of information under Article 12 is carried out in a timely manner and that in that regard the requests for information made by Europol are treated as if they originate from another FIU. Article 14 Data protection requirements 1. The processing of personal data related to bank account information, financial information and financial analysis referred to in Articles 11 and 12 of this Directive shall be performed in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2016/794 and only by the staff of Europol who have been specifically designated and authorised to perform those tasks. 2. Europol shall inform the data protection officer appointed in accordance with Article 41 of Regulation (EU) 2016/794 of each exchange of information pursuant to Articles 11, 12 and 13 of this Directive. CHAPTER V ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA Article 15 Scope This Chapter applies only to designated competent authorities and FIUs in respect of the exchange of information pursuant to Chapter III and in respect of the exchange of financial information and financial analysis involving the Europol national units pursuant to Chapter IV. Article 16 Processing of sensitive personal data 1. The processing of personal data revealing a persons racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership or of data concerning a natural persons health, sex life or sexual orientation shall only be allowed subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in accordance with the applicable data protection rules. 2. Only staff who have been specifically trained and who have been specifically authorised by the controller may access and process the data referred to in paragraph 1 under the guidance of the data protection officer. Article 17 Records of information requests Member States shall ensure that records are kept relating to requests for information pursuant to this Directive. Those records shall contain at least the following information: (a) the name and contact details of the organisation and of the staff member requesting the information and, as far as possible, of the recipient of the results of the query or search; (b) the reference to the national case in relation to which the information is requested; (c) the subject matter of the requests; and (d) any executing measures of such requests. The records shall be kept for a period of five years after their creation and shall be used solely for the purpose of checking the lawfulness of the processing of personal data. The authorities concerned shall make all records available to the national supervisory authority upon its request. Article 18 Restrictions to data subjects rights Member States may adopt legislative measures restricting, in whole or in part, data subjects right of access to personal data relating to them processed under this Directive, in accordance with Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or with Article 15(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable. CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 19 Monitoring 1. Member States shall review the effectiveness of their systems to combat serious criminal offences by maintaining comprehensive statistics. 2. By 1 February 2020, the Commission shall establish a detailed programme for monitoring the outputs, results and impact of this Directive. That programme shall set out the means by which, and the intervals at which, the data and other necessary evidence will be collected. It shall specify the action to be taken by the Commission and by the Member States in collecting and analysing the data and other evidence. Member States shall provide the Commission with the data and other evidence necessary for the monitoring. 3. In any event, the statistics referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the following information: (a) the number of searches carried out by designated competent authorities in accordance with Article 4; (b) data measuring the volume of requests issued by each authority under this Directive, the follow-up given to those requests, the number of cases investigated, the number of persons prosecuted and the number of persons convicted for serious criminal offences, where such information is available; (c) data measuring the time it takes an authority to respond to a request after the receipt of the request; (d) if available, data measuring the cost of human or IT resources that are dedicated to domestic and cross-border requests falling under this Directive. 4. Member States shall organise the production and gathering of the statistics and shall transmit the statistics referred to in paragraph 3 to the Commission on an annual basis. Article 20 Relationship to other instruments 1. This Directive shall not preclude Member States from maintaining or concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements between themselves on the exchange of information between competent authorities, insofar as such agreements or arrangements are compatible with Union law, in particular with this Directive. 2. This Directive is without prejudice to any obligations and commitments of Member States or of the Union under existing bilateral or multilateral agreements with third countries. 3. Without prejudice to the division of competences between the Union and the Member States, in accordance with Union law, Member States shall notify the Commission of their intention to enter into negotiations on, and to conclude, agreements between Member States and third countries that are contracting parties of the European Economic Area on matters falling within the scope of Chapter II of this Directive. If, within two months of receipt of notification of a Member States intention to enter into the negotiations referred to in the first subparagraph, the Commission concludes that the negotiations are likely to undermine relevant Union policies or to lead to an agreement which is incompatible with Union law, it shall inform the Member State accordingly. Member States shall keep the Commission regularly informed of any such negotiations and, where appropriate, invite the Commission to participate as an observer. Member States shall be authorised to apply provisionally or to conclude agreements referred to in the first subparagraph, provided that they are compatible with Union law and do not harm the object and purpose of the relevant policies of the Union. The Commission shall adopt such authorisation decisions by implementing acts. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 22.

By 2 August 2024, the Commission shall carry out an assessment of the opportunities and challenges regarding an extension of the exchange of financial information or financial analysis between FIUs within the Union to cover exchanges relating to serious criminal offences other than terrorism or organised crime associated with terrorism. 5. No sooner than 2 August 2027, the Commission shall carry out an evaluation of this Directive and present a report on the main findings to the European Parliament and the Council.

(2) Principle No 5 of the European Pillar of Social Rights, proclaimed at Gothenburg on 17 November 2017, provides that, regardless of the type and duration of the employment relationship, workers have the right to fair and equal treatment regarding working conditions, access to social protection and training, and that the transition towards open-ended forms of employment is to be fostered; that, in accordance with legislation and collective agreements, the necessary flexibility for employers to adapt swiftly to changes in the economic context is to be ensured; that innovative forms of work that ensure quality working conditions are to be fostered, that entrepreneurship and self-employment are to be encouraged and that occupational mobility is to be facilitated; and that employment relationships that lead to precarious working conditions are to be prevented, including by prohibiting abuse of atypical contracts, and that any probationary period is to be of a reasonable duration. (3) Principle No 7 of the European Pillar of Social Rights provides that workers have the right to be informed in writing at the start of employment about their rights and obligations resulting from the employment relationship, including any probationary period; that prior to any dismissal they are entitled to be informed of the reasons and given a reasonable period of notice; and that they have the right to access to effective and impartial dispute resolution and, in the case of unjustified dismissal, a right to redress, including adequate compensation. (4) Since the adoption of Council Directive 91/533/EEC (4), labour markets have undergone far-reaching changes due to demographic developments and digitalisation leading to the creation of new forms of employment, which have enhanced innovation, job creation and labour market growth. Some new forms of employment vary significantly from traditional employment relationships with regard to predictability, creating uncertainty with regard to the applicable rights and the social protection of the workers concerned. In this evolving world of work, there is therefore an increased need for workers to be fully informed about their essential working conditions, which should occur in a timely manner and in written form to which workers have easy access. In order adequately to frame the development of new forms of employment, workers in the Union should also be provided with a number of new minimum rights aiming to promote security and predictability in employment relationships while achieving upward convergence across Member States and preserving labour market adaptability. (5) Pursuant to Directive 91/533/EEC, the majority of workers in the Union have the right to receive written information about their working conditions. Directive 91/533/EEC does not however apply to all workers in the Union. Moreover, gaps in protection have emerged for new forms of employment created as a result of labour market developments since 1991. (6) Minimum requirements relating to information on the essential aspects of the employment relationship and relating to working conditions that apply to every worker should therefore be established at Union level in order to guarantee all workers in the Union an adequate degree of transparency and predictability as regards their working conditions, while maintaining reasonable flexibility of non-standard employment, thus preserving its benefits to workers and employers. (7) The Commission has undertaken a two-phase consultation with the social partners, in accordance with Article 154 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on the improvement of the scope and effectiveness of Directive 91/533/EEC and the broadening of its objectives in order to establish new rights for workers. This did not result in an agreement among the social partners to enter into negotiations on those matters. However, as confirmed by the outcome of the open public consultations that sought the views of various stakeholders and citizens, it is important to take action at Union level in this area by modernising and adapting the current legal framework to new developments. (8) In its case law, the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice) has established criteria for determining the status of a worker (5). The interpretation of the Court of Justice of those criteria should be taken into account in the implementation of this Directive. Provided that they fulfil those criteria, domestic workers, on-demand workers, intermittent workers, voucher based-workers, platform workers, trainees and apprentices could fall within the scope of this Directive. Genuinely self-employed persons should not fall within the scope of this Directive since they do not fulfil those criteria. The abuse of the status of self-employed persons, as defined in national law, either at national level or in cross-border situations, is a form of falsely declared work that is frequently associated with undeclared work. Bogus self-employment occurs when a person is declared to be self-employed while fulfilling the conditions characteristic of an employment relationship, in order to avoid certain legal or fiscal obligations. Such persons should fall within the scope of this Directive. The determination of the existence of an employment relationship should be guided by the facts relating to the actual performance of the work and not by the parties description of the relationship. (9) It should be possible for Member States to provide, where justified on objective grounds, for certain provisions of this Directive not to apply to certain categories of civil servants, public emergency services, the armed forces, police authorities, judges, prosecutors, investigators or other law enforcement services, given the specific nature of the duties that they are called on to perform or of their employment conditions. (10) The requirements laid down in this Directive with regard to the following matters should not apply to seafarers or sea fishermen, given the specificities of their employment conditions: parallel employment where incompatible with the work performed on board ships or fishing vessels, minimum predictability of work, the sending of workers to another Member State or to a third country, transition to another form of employment, and providing information on the identity of the social security institutions receiving the social contributions. For the purposes of this Directive, seafarers and sea fishermen as defined, respectively, in Council Directives 2009/13/EC (6) and (EU) 2017/159 (7) should be considered to be working in the Union when they work on board ships or fishing vessels registered in a Member State or flying the flag of a Member State. (11) In view of the increasing number of workers excluded from the scope of Directive 91/533/EEC on the basis of exclusions made by Member States under Article 1 of that directive, it is necessary to replace those exclusions with a possibility for Member States not to apply the provisions of this Directive to an employment relationship with predetermined and actual working hours that amount to an average of three hours per week or less in a reference period of four consecutive weeks. The calculation of those hours should include all time actually worked for an employer, such as overtime or work supplementary to that guaranteed or anticipated in the employment contract or employment relationship. From the moment when a worker crosses that threshold, the provisions of this Directive apply to him or her, regardless of the number of working hours that the worker works subsequently or the number of working hours provided for in the employment contract. (12) Workers who have no guaranteed working time, including those on zero-hour and some on-demand contracts, are in a particularly vulnerable situation. Therefore, the provisions of this Directive should apply to them regardless of the number of hours they actually work. (13) Several different natural or legal persons or other entities may in practice assume the functions and responsibilities of an employer. Member States should remain free to determine more precisely the persons who are considered to be wholly or partly responsible for the execution of the obligations that this Directive lays down for employers, as long as all those obligations are fulfilled. Member States should also be able to decide that some or all of those obligations are to be assigned to a natural or legal person who is not party to the employment relationship. (14) Member States should be able to establish specific rules to exclude individuals acting as employers for domestic workers in the household from the requirements laid down in this Directive, with regard to the following matters: to consider and respond to requests for different types of employment, to provide mandatory training that is free of cost, and to provide for redress mechanisms that are based on favourable presumptions in the case of information that is missing from the documentation that is to be provided to the worker under this Directive. (15) Directive 91/533/EEC introduced a list of essential aspects of the employment contract or employment relationship of which workers are to be informed in writing. It is necessary to adapt that list, which Member States can enlarge, in order to take account of developments in the labour market, in particular the growth of non-standard forms of employment. (16) Where the worker has no fixed or main place of work, he or she should receive information about arrangements, if any, for travel between the workplaces. (17) It should be possible for information on the training entitlement provided by the employer to take the form of information that includes the number of training days, if any, to which the worker is entitled per year, and information about the employers general training policy. (18) It should be possible for information on the procedure to be observed by the employer and the worker if their employment relationship is terminated to include the deadline for bringing an action contesting dismissal. (19) Information on working time should be consistent with Directive 2003/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), and should include information on breaks, daily and weekly rest periods and the amount of paid leave, thereby ensuring the protection of the safety and health of workers. (20) Information on remuneration to be provided should include all elements of the remuneration indicated separately, including, if applicable, contributions in cash or kind, overtime payments, bonuses and other entitlements, directly or indirectly received by the worker in respect of his or her work. The provision of such information should be without prejudice to the freedom for employers to provide for additional elements of remuneration such as one-off payments. The fact that elements of remuneration due by law or collective agreement have not been included in that information should not constitute a reason for not providing them to the worker. (21) If it is not possible to indicate a fixed work schedule because of the nature of the employment, such as in the case of an on-demand contract, employers should inform workers how their working time is to be established, including the time slots in which they may be called to work and the minimum notice period that they are to receive before the start of a work assignment. (22) Information on social security systems should include information on the identity of the social security institutions receiving the social security contributions, where relevant, with regard to sickness, maternity, paternity and parental benefits, benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases, and old-age, invalidity, survivors, unemployment, pre-retirement and family benefits. Employers should not be required to provide that information where the worker chooses the social security institution. Information on the social security protection provided by the employer should include, where relevant, the fact of coverage by supplementary pension schemes within the meaning of Directive 2014/50/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) and Council Directive 98/49/EC (10). (23) Workers should have the right to be informed about their rights and obligations resulting from the employment relationship in writing at the start of employment. The basic information should therefore reach them as soon as possible and at the latest within a calendar week from their first working day. The remaining information should reach them within one month from their first working day. The first working day should be understood to be the actual start of performance of work by the worker in the employment relationship. Member States should aim to have the relevant information on the employment relationship provided by the employers before the end of the initially agreed duration of the contract. (24) In light of the increasing use of digital communication tools, information that is to be provided in writing under this Directive can be provided by electronic means. (25) In order to help employers to provide timely information, Member States should be able to provide templates at national level including relevant and sufficiently comprehensive information on the legal framework applicable. Those templates could be further developed at sectoral or local level, by national authorities and the social partners. The Commission will support Member States in developing templates and models and make them widely available, as appropriate. (26) Workers sent abroad should receive additional information specific to their situation. For successive work assignments in several Member States or third countries, it should be possible for the information for several assignments to be collated before the first departure and subsequently modified in the case of any changes. Workers who qualify as posted workers under Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) should also be notified of the single official national website developed by the host Member State where they are able to find the relevant information on the working conditions applying to their situation. Unless Member States provide otherwise, those obligations apply if the duration of the work period abroad is longer than four consecutive weeks. (27) Probationary periods allow the parties to the employment relationship to verify that the workers and the positions for which they were engaged are compatible while providing workers with accompanying support. An entry into the labour market or a transition to a new position should not be subject to prolonged insecurity. As established in the European Pillar of Social Rights, probationary periods should therefore be of a reasonable duration. (28) A substantial number of Member States have established a general maximum duration of probation of between three and six months, which should be considered to be reasonable. Exceptionally, it should be possible for probationary periods to last longer than six months, where justified by the nature of the employment, such as for managerial or executive positions or public service posts, or where in the interests of the worker, such as in the context of specific measures promoting permanent employment, in particular for young workers. It should also be possible for probationary periods to be extended correspondingly in cases where the worker has been absent from work during the probationary period, for instance because of sickness or leave, to enable the employer to assess the suitability of the worker for the task in question. In the case of fixed-term employment relationships of less than 12 months, Member States should ensure that the length of the probationary period is adequate and proportionate to the expected duration of the contract and the nature of the work. Where provided for in national law or practice, workers should be able to accrue employment rights during the probationary period. (29) An employer should neither prohibit a worker from taking up employment with other employers, outside the work schedule established with that employer, nor subject a worker to adverse treatment for doing so. It should be possible for Member States to lay down conditions for the use of incompatibility restrictions, which are to be understood as restrictions on working for other employers for objective reasons, such as for the protection of the health and safety of workers including by limiting working time, the protection of business confidentiality, the integrity of the public service or the avoidance of conflicts of interests. (30) Workers whose work pattern is entirely or mostly unpredictable should benefit from a minimum level of predictability where the work schedule is determined mainly by the employer, be it directly, such as by allocating work assignments, or indirectly, such as by requiring the worker to respond to clients requests. (31) Reference hours and days, which are to be understood as time slots during which work can take place at the request of the employer, should be established in writing at the start of the employment relationship. (32) A reasonable minimum notice period, which is to be understood as the period of time between the moment when a worker is informed of a new work assignment and the moment when the assignment starts, constitutes another necessary element of predictability of work for employment relationships with work patterns which are entirely or mostly unpredictable. The length of the notice period may vary according to the needs of the sector concerned, while ensuring the adequate protection of workers. The minimum notice period applies without prejudice to Directive 2002/15/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). (33) Workers should have the possibility to refuse a work assignment if it falls outside of the reference hours and days or if they were not notified of the work assignment in accordance with the minimum notice period, without suffering adverse consequences for this refusal. Workers should also have the possibility to accept the work assignment if they so wish. (34) Where a worker whose work pattern is entirely or mostly unpredictable has agreed with his or her employer to undertake a specific work assignment, the worker should be able to plan accordingly. The worker should be protected against loss of income resulting from the late cancellation of an agreed work assignment by means of adequate compensation. (35) On-demand or similar employment contracts, including zero-hour contracts, under which the employer has the flexibility of calling the worker to work as and when needed, are particularly unpredictable for the worker. Member States that allow such contracts should ensure that effective measures to prevent their abuse are in place. Such measures could take the form of limitations to the use and duration of such contracts, of a rebuttable presumption of the existence of an employment contract or employment relationship with a guaranteed amount of paid hours based on hours worked in a preceding reference period, or of other equivalent measures that ensure the effective prevention of abusive practices. (36) Where employers have the possibility to offer full-time or open-ended employment contracts to workers in non-standard forms of employment, a transition to more secure forms of employment should be promoted in accordance with the principles established in the European Pillar of Social Rights. Workers should be able to request another more predictable and secure form of employment, where available, and receive a reasoned written response from the employer, which takes into account the needs of the employer and of the worker. Member States should have the possibility to limit the frequency of such requests. This Directive should not prevent Member States from establishing that, in the case of public service positions for which entry is by competitive examination, those positions are not to be considered to be available on the simple request of the worker, and so fall outside the scope of the right to request a form of employment with more predictable and secure working conditions. (37) Where employers are required by Union or national law or collective agreements to provide training to workers to carry out the work for which they are employed, it is important to ensure that such training is provided equally to all workers, including to those in non-standard forms of employment. The costs of such training should not be charged to the worker or withheld or deducted from the workers remuneration. Such training should count as working time and, where possible, should be carried out during working hours. That obligation does not cover vocational training or training required for workers to obtain, maintain or renew a professional qualification as long as the employer is not required by Union or national law or collective agreement to provide it to the worker. Member States should take the necessary measures to protect workers from abusive practices regarding training. (38) The autonomy of the social partners and their capacity as representatives of workers and employers should be respected. It should therefore be possible for the social partners to consider that in specific sectors or situations different provisions are more appropriate, for the pursuit of the purpose of this Directive, than certain minimum standards set out in this Directive. Member States should therefore be able to allow the social partners to maintain, negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements which differ from certain provisions contained in this Directive, provided that the overall level of protection of workers is not lowered. (39) The public consultation on the European Pillar of Social Rights showed the need to strengthen enforcement of Union labour law to ensure its effectiveness. The evaluation of Directive 91/533/EEC conducted under the Commissions Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme confirmed that strengthened enforcement mechanisms could improve the effectiveness of Union labour law. The consultation showed that redress systems based solely on claims for damages are less effective than systems that also provide for penalties, such as lump sums or loss of permits, for employers who fail to issue written statements. It also showed that employees rarely seek redress during the employment relationship, which jeopardises the goal of the provision of the written statement, which is to ensure that workers are informed about the essential features of the employment relationship. It is therefore necessary to introduce enforcement provisions which ensure the use of favourable presumptions where information about the employment relationship is not provided, or of a procedure under which the employer may be required to provide the missing information and may be subject to a penalty if the employer does not do so, or both. It should be possible for such favourable presumptions to include a presumption that the worker has an open-ended employment relationship, that there is no probationary period or that the worker has a full-time position, where the relevant information is missing. Redress could be subject to a procedure by which the employer is notified by the worker or by a third party such as a workers representative or other competent authority or body that information is missing and to supply complete and correct information in a timely manner. (40) An extensive system of enforcement provisions for the social acquis in the Union has been adopted since Directive 91/533/EEC, in particular in the fields of equal treatment, elements of which should be applied to this Directive in order to ensure that workers have access to effective and impartial dispute resolution, such as a civil or labour court and a right to redress, which may include adequate compensation, reflecting the Principle No 7 of the European Pillar of Social Rights. (41) Specifically, having regard to the fundamental nature of the right to effective legal protection, workers should continue to enjoy such protection even after the end of the employment relationship giving rise to an alleged breach of the workers rights under this Directive. (42) The effective implementation of this Directive requires adequate judicial and administrative protection against any adverse treatment as a reaction to an attempt to exercise rights provided for under this Directive, any complaint to the employer or any legal or administrative proceedings aimed at enforcing compliance with this Directive. (43) Workers exercising rights provided for in this Directive should enjoy protection from dismissal or equivalent detriment, such as an on-demand worker no longer being assigned work, or any preparations for a possible dismissal, on the grounds that they sought to exercise such rights. Where workers consider that they have been dismissed or have suffered equivalent detriment on those grounds, workers and competent authorities or bodies should be able to require the employer to provide duly substantiated grounds for the dismissal or equivalent measure. (44) The burden of proof with regard to establishing that there has been no dismissal or equivalent detriment on the grounds that workers have exercised their rights provided for in this Directive, should fall on employers when workers establish, before a court or other competent authority or body, facts from which it may be presumed that they have been dismissed, or have been subject to measures with equivalent effect, on such grounds. It should be possible for Member States not to apply that rule in proceedings, in which it would be for a court or other competent authority or body to investigate the facts, in particular in systems where dismissal has to be approved beforehand by such authority or body. (45) Member States should provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for breaches of the obligations under this Directive. Penalties can include administrative and financial penalties, such as fines or the payment of compensation, as well as other types of penalties. (46) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to improve working conditions by promoting more transparent and predictable employment while ensuring labour market adaptability, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the need to establish common minimum requirements, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (47) This Directive lays down minimum requirements, thus leaving untouched Member States prerogative to introduce and maintain more favourable provisions. Rights acquired under the existing legal framework should continue to apply, unless more favourable provisions are introduced by this Directive. The implementation of this Directive cannot be used to reduce existing rights set out in existing Union or national law in this field, nor can it constitute valid grounds for reducing the general level of protection afforded to workers in the field covered by this Directive. In particular, it should not serve as grounds for the introduction of zero-hour contracts or similar types of employment contracts. (48) In implementing this Directive Member States should avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Member States are therefore invited to assess the impact of their transposition act on small and medium-sized enterprises in order to ensure that they are not disproportionately affected, giving specific attention to micro-enterprises and to the administrative burden, and to publish the results of such assessments. (49) The Member States may entrust the social partners with the implementation of this Directive, where the social partners jointly request to do so and provided that the Member States take all the necessary steps to ensure that they can at all times guarantee the results sought under this Directive. They should also, in accordance with national law and practice, take adequate measures to ensure the effective involvement of the social partners and to promote and enhance social dialogue with a view to implementing the provisions of this Directive. (50) Member States should take any adequate measure to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising from this Directive, for example by carrying out inspections, as appropriate. (51) In view of the substantial changes introduced by this Directive with regard to the purpose, scope and content of Directive 91/533/EEC, it is not appropriate to amend that directive. Directive 91/533/EEC should therefore be repealed. (52) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (13), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Purpose, subject matter and scope 1. The purpose of this Directive is to improve working conditions by promoting more transparent and predictable employment while ensuring labour market adaptability. 2. This Directive lays down minimum rights that apply to every worker in the Union who has an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by the law, collective agreements or practice in force in each Member State with consideration to the case-law of the Court of Justice. 3. Member States may decide not to apply the obligations in this Directive to workers who have an employment relationship in which their predetermined and actual working time is equal to or less than an average of three hours per week in a reference period of four consecutive weeks. Time worked with all employers forming or belonging to the same enterprise, group or entity shall count towards that three-hour average. 4. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to an employment relationship where no guaranteed amount of paid work is predetermined before the employment starts. 5. Member States may determine which persons are responsible for the execution of the obligations for employers laid down by this Directive as long as all those obligations are fulfilled. They may also decide that all or part of those obligations are to be assigned to a natural or legal person who is not party to the employment relationship. This paragraph is without prejudice to Directive 2008/104/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). 6. Member States may provide, on objective grounds, that the provisions laid down in Chapter III are not to apply to civil servants, public emergency services, the armed forces, police authorities, judges, prosecutors, investigators or other law enforcement services. 7. Member States may decide not to apply the obligations set out in Articles 12 and 13 and in point (a) of Article 15(1) to natural persons in households acting as employers where work is performed for those households. 8. Chapter II of this Directive applies to seafarers and sea fishermen without prejudice to Directives 2009/13/EC and Directive (EU) 2017/159, respectively. The obligations set out in points (m) and (o) of Article 4(2), and Articles 7, 9, 10 and 12 shall not apply to seafarers or sea fishermen. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (a) work schedule means the schedule determining the hours and days on which performance of work starts and ends; (b) reference hours and days means time slots in specified days during which work can take place at the request of the employer; (c) work pattern means the form of organisation of the working time and its distribution according to a certain pattern determined by the employer. Article 3 Provision of information The employer shall provide each worker with the information required pursuant to this Directive in writing. The information shall be provided and transmitted on paper or, provided that the information is accessible to the worker, that it can be stored and printed, and that the employer retains proof of transmission or receipt, in electronic form.

The other information referred to in Article 4(2) shall be provided individually to the worker in the form of a document within one month of the first working day. 2. Member States may develop templates and models for the documents referred to in paragraph 1 and put them at the disposal of worker and employer including by making them available on a single official national website or by other suitable means. 3. Member States shall ensure that the information on the laws, regulations and administrative or statutory provisions or universally applicable collective agreements governing the legal framework applicable which are to be communicated by employers is made generally available free of charge in a clear, transparent, comprehensive and easily accessible way at a distance and by electronic means, including through existing online portals. Article 6 Modification of the employment relationship 1. Member States shall ensure that any change in the aspects of the employment relationship referred to in Article 4(2) and any change to the additional information for workers sent to another Member State or to a third country referred to in Article 7 shall be provided in the form of a document by the employer to the worker at the earliest opportunity and at the latest on the day on which it takes effect. 2. The document referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to changes that merely reflect a change in the laws, regulations and administrative or statutory provisions or collective agreements cited in the documents referred to in Article 5(1), and, where relevant, in Article 7. Article 7 Additional information for workers sent to another Member State or to a third country 1.

Unless Member States provide otherwise, paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the duration of each work period outside the Member State in which the worker habitually works is four consecutive weeks or less. CHAPTER III MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO WORKING CONDITIONS Article 8 Maximum duration of any probationary period 1. Member States shall ensure that, where an employment relationship is subject to a probationary period as defined in national law or practice, that period shall not exceed six months. 2. In the case of fixed-term employment relationships, Member States shall ensure that the length of such a probationary period is proportionate to the expected duration of the contract and the nature of the work. In the case of the renewal of a contract for the same function and tasks, the employment relationship shall not be subject to a new probationary period. 3. Member States may, on an exceptional basis, provide for longer probationary periods where justified by the nature of the employment or in the interest of the worker. Where the worker has been absent from work during the probationary period, Member States may provide that the probationary period can be extended correspondingly, in relation to the duration of the absence. Article 9 Parallel employment 1. Member States shall ensure that an employer neither prohibits a worker from taking up employment with other employers, outside the work schedule established with that employer, nor subjects a worker to adverse treatment for doing so. 2. Member States may lay down conditions for the use of incompatibility restrictions by employers, on the basis of objective grounds, such as health and safety, the protection of business confidentiality, the integrity of the public service or the avoidance of conflicts of interests. Article 10 Minimum predictability of work 1. Member States shall ensure that where a workers work pattern is entirely or mostly unpredictable the worker shall not be required to work by the employer unless both of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the work takes place within predetermined reference hours and days as referred to in point (m)(ii) of Article 4(2); and (b) the worker is informed by his or her employer of a work assignment within a reasonable notice period established in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practice as referred to in point (m)(iii) of Article 4(2). 2. Where one or both of the requirements laid down in paragraph 1 is not fulfilled, a worker shall have the right to refuse a work assignment without adverse consequences. 3. Where Member States allow an employer to cancel a work assignment without compensation, Member States shall take the measures necessary, in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practice, to ensure that the worker is entitled to compensation if the employer cancels, after a specified reasonable deadline, the work assignment previously agreed with the worker. 4. Member States may lay down modalities for the application of this Article, in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practice. Article 11 Complementary measures for on-demand contracts Where Member States allow for the use of on-demand or similar employment contracts, they shall take one or more of the following measures to prevent abusive practices: (a) limitations to the use and duration of on-demand or similar employment contracts; (b) a rebuttable presumption of the existence of an employment contract with a minimum amount of paid hours based on the average hours worked during a given period; (c) other equivalent measures that ensure effective prevention of abusive practices. Member States shall inform the Commission of such measures. Article 12 Transition to another form of employment 1. Member States shall ensure that a worker with at least six months service with the same employer, who has completed his or her probationary period, if any, may request a form of employment with more predictable and secure working conditions where available and receive a reasoned written reply. Member States may limit the frequency of requests triggering the obligation under this Article. 2. Member States shall ensure that the employer provides the reasoned written reply referred to in paragraph 1 within one month of the request. With respect to natural persons acting as employers and micro, small, or medium enterprises, Member States may provide for that deadline to be extended to no more than three months and allow for an oral reply to a subsequent similar request submitted by the same worker if the justification for the reply as regards the situation of the worker remains unchanged. Article 13 Mandatory training Member States shall ensure that where an employer is required by Union or national law or by collective agreements to provide training to a worker to carry out the work for which he or she is employed, such training shall be provided to the worker free of cost, shall count as working time and, where possible, shall take place during working hours. Article 14 Collective agreements Member States may allow the social partners to maintain, negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements, in conformity with the national law or practice, which, while respecting the overall protection of workers, establish arrangements concerning the working conditions of workers which differ from those referred to in Articles 8 to 13. CHAPTER IV HORIZONTAL PROVISIONS Article 15 Legal presumptions and early settlement mechanism 1. Member States shall ensure that, where a worker has not received in due time all or part of the documents referred to in Article 5(1) or Article 6, one or both of the following shall apply: (a) the worker shall benefit from favourable presumptions defined by the Member State, which employers shall have the possibility to rebut; (b) the worker shall have the possibility to submit a complaint to a competent authority or body and to receive adequate redress in a timely and effective manner. 2. Member States may provide that the application of the presumptions and mechanism referred to in paragraph 1 is subject to the notification of the employer and the failure of the employer to provide the missing information in a timely manner. Article 16 Right to redress Member States shall ensure that workers, including those whose employment relationship has ended, have access to effective and impartial dispute resolution and a right to redress in the case of infringements of their rights arising from this Directive. Article 17 Protection against adverse treatment or consequences Member States shall introduce the measures necessary to protect workers, including those who are workers representatives, from any adverse treatment by the employer and from any adverse consequences resulting from a complaint lodged with the employer or resulting from any proceedings initiated with the aim of enforcing compliance with the rights provided for in this Directive. Article 18 Protection from dismissal and burden of proof 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to prohibit the dismissal or its equivalent and all preparations for dismissal of workers, on the grounds that they have exercised the rights provided for in this Directive. 2. Workers who consider that they have been dismissed, or have been subject to measures with equivalent effect, on the grounds that they have exercised the rights provided for in this Directive, may request the employer to provide duly substantiated grounds for the dismissal or the equivalent measures. The employer shall provide those grounds in writing. 3. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, when workers referred to in paragraph 2 establish, before a court or other competent authority or body, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been such a dismissal or equivalent measures, it shall be for the employer to prove that the dismissal was based on grounds other than those referred to in paragraph 1. 4. Paragraph 3 shall not prevent Member States from introducing rules of evidence which are more favourable to workers. 5. Member States shall not be required to apply paragraph 3 to proceedings in which it is for the court or other competent authority or body to investigate the facts of the case. 6. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to criminal proceedings, unless otherwise provided by the Member State. Article 19 Penalties Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive or the relevant provisions already in force concerning the rights which are within the scope of this Directive. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. CHAPTER V FINAL PROVISIONS Article 20 Non-regression and more favourable provisions 1. This Directive shall not constitute valid grounds for reducing the general level of protection already afforded to workers within Member States. 2. This Directive shall not affect Member States prerogative to apply or to introduce laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are more favourable to workers or to encourage or permit the application of collective agreements which are more favourable to workers. 3. This Directive is without prejudice to any other rights conferred on workers by other legal acts of the Union. Article 21 Transposition and implementation 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to comply with this Directive by 1 August 2022. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof. 2. When Member States adopt the measures referred to in paragraph 1, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States. 3. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main measures of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 4. Member States shall, in accordance with their national law and practice, take adequate measures to ensure the effective involvement of the social partners and to promote and enhance social dialogue with a view to implementing this Directive. 5. Member States may entrust the social partners with the implementation of this Directive, where the social partners jointly request to do so and provided that Member States take all necessary steps to ensure that they can at all times guarantee the results sought under this Directive. Article 22 Transitional arrangements The rights and obligations set out in this Directive shall apply to all employment relationships by 1 August 2022. However, an employer shall provide or complement the documents referred to in Article 5(1) and in Articles 6 and 7 only upon the request of a worker who is already employed on that date. The absence of such a request shall not have the effect of excluding a worker from the minimum rights established in Articles 8 to 13. Article 23 Review by the Commission By 1 August 2027, the Commission shall, after consulting the Member States and the social partners at Union level and taking into account the impact on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, review the implementation of this Directive and propose, where appropriate, legislative amendments. Article 24 Repeal Directive 91/533/EEC shall be repealed with effect from 1 August 2022. References to the repealed Directive shall be construed as references to this Directive. Article 25 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Without affecting workers' fundamental rights and freedoms, this Directive aims to remove such obstacles by ensuring that: viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks which enable them to continue operating; honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby allowing them a second chance; and that the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. (2) Restructuring should enable debtors in financial difficulties to continue business, in whole or in part, by changing the composition, conditions or structure of their assets and their liabilities or any other part of their capital structure  including by sales of assets or parts of the business or, where so provided under national law, the business as a whole  as well as by carrying out operational changes. Unless otherwise specifically provided for by national law, operational changes, such as the termination or amendment of contracts or the sale or other disposal of assets, should comply with the general requirements that are provided for under national law for such measures, in particular civil law and labour law rules. Any debt-to-equity swaps should also comply with safeguards provided for by national law. Preventive restructuring frameworks should, above all, enable debtors to restructure effectively at an early stage and to avoid insolvency, thus limiting the unnecessary liquidation of viable enterprises. Those frameworks should help to prevent job losses and the loss of know-how and skills, and maximise the total value to creditors  in comparison to what they would receive in the event of the liquidation of the enterprise's assets or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario in the absence of a plan  as well as to owners and the economy as a whole. (3) Preventive restructuring frameworks should also prevent the build-up of non-performing loans. The availability of effective preventive restructuring frameworks would ensure that action is taken before enterprises default on their loans, thereby helping to reduce the risk of loans becoming non-performing in cyclical downturns and mitigating the adverse impact on the financial sector. A significant percentage of businesses and jobs could be saved if preventive frameworks existed in all the Member States in which businesses' places of establishment, assets or creditors are situated. In restructuring frameworks the rights of all parties involved, including workers, should be protected in a balanced manner. At the same time, non-viable businesses with no prospect of survival should be liquidated as quickly as possible. Where a debtor in financial difficulties is not economically viable or cannot be readily restored to economic viability, restructuring efforts could result in the acceleration and accumulation of losses to the detriment of creditors, workers and other stakeholders, as well as the economy as a whole. (4) There are differences between Member States as regards the range of the procedures available to debtors in financial difficulties in order to restructure their business. Some Member States have a limited range of procedures that allow the restructuring of businesses only at a relatively late stage, in the context of insolvency procedures. In other Member States, restructuring is possible at an earlier stage but the procedures available are not as effective as they could be, or they are very formal, in particular because they limit the use of out-of-court arrangements. Preventive solutions are a growing trend in insolvency law. The trend favours approaches that, unlike the traditional approach of liquidating a business in financial difficulties, have the aim of restoring it to a healthy state or, at least, saving those of its units which are still economically viable. That approach, among other benefits to the economy, often helps to maintain jobs or reduce job losses. Moreover, the degree of involvement of judicial or administrative authorities, or the persons appointed by them, varies from no involvement or minimal involvement in some Member States to full involvement in others. Similarly, national rules giving entrepreneurs a second chance, in particular by granting them discharge from the debts they have incurred in the course of their business, vary between Member States in respect of the length of the discharge period and the conditions for granting such a discharge. (5) In many Member States, it takes more than three years for entrepreneurs who are insolvent but honest to be discharged from their debts and make a fresh start. Inefficient discharge of debt and disqualification frameworks result in entrepreneurs having to relocate to other jurisdictions in order to benefit from a fresh start in a reasonable period of time, at considerable additional cost to both their creditors and the entrepreneurs themselves. Long disqualification orders, which often accompany a procedure leading to discharge of debt, create obstacles to the freedom to take up and pursue a self-employed, entrepreneurial activity. (6) The excessive length of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt in several Member States is an important factor triggering low recovery rates and deterring investors from carrying out business in jurisdictions where procedures risk taking too long and being unduly costly. (7) Differences between Member States in relation to procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt translate into additional costs for investors when assessing the risk of debtors getting into financial difficulties in one or more Member States, or of investing in viable businesses in financial difficulties, as well as additional costs of restructuring enterprises that have establishments, creditors or assets in other Member States. This is most notably the case with restructuring international groups of companies. Investors mention uncertainty about insolvency rules or the risk of lengthy or complex insolvency procedures in another Member State as being one of the main reasons for not investing or not entering into a business relationship with a counterpart outside the Member State where they are based. That uncertainty acts as a disincentive which obstructs the freedom of establishment of undertakings and the promotion of entrepreneurship and harms the proper functioning of the internal market. Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular do not, for the most part, have the resources needed to assess risks related to cross-border activities. (8) The differences among Member States in procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt lead to uneven conditions for access to credit and to uneven recovery rates in the Member States. A higher degree of harmonisation in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications is thus indispensable for a well-functioning internal market in general and for a working Capital Markets Union in particular, as well as for the resilience of European economies, including for the preservation and creation of jobs. (9) The additional cost of risk-assessment and of cross-border enforcement of claims for creditors of over-indebted entrepreneurs who relocate to another Member State in order to obtain a discharge of debt in a much shorter period of time should also be reduced. The additional costs for entrepreneurs stemming from the need to relocate to another Member State in order to benefit from a discharge of debt should also be reduced. Furthermore, the obstacles stemming from long disqualification orders linked to an entrepreneur's insolvency or over-indebtedness inhibit entrepreneurship. (10) Any restructuring operation, in particular one of major size which generates a significant impact, should be based on a dialogue with the stakeholders. That dialogue should cover the choice of the measures envisaged in relation to the objectives of the restructuring operation, as well as alternative options, and there should be appropriate involvement of employees' representatives as provided for in Union and national law. (11) The obstacles to the exercise of fundamental freedoms are not limited to purely cross-border situations. An increasingly interconnected internal market, in which goods, services, capital and workers circulate freely, and which has an ever-stronger digital dimension, means that very few enterprises are purely national if all relevant elements are considered, such as their client base, supply chain, scope of activities, investor and capital base. Even purely national insolvencies can have an impact on the functioning of the internal market through the so-called domino effect of insolvencies, whereby a debtor's insolvency may trigger further insolvencies in the supply chain. (12) Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) deals with issues of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement, applicable law and cooperation in cross-border insolvency proceedings as well as with the interconnection of insolvency registers. Its scope covers preventive procedures which promote the rescue of economically viable debtors as well as discharge procedures for entrepreneurs and other natural persons. However, that Regulation does not tackle the disparities between national laws regulating those procedures. Furthermore, an instrument limited only to cross-border insolvencies would not remove all obstacles to free movement, nor would it be feasible for investors to determine in advance the cross-border or domestic nature of the potential financial difficulties of the debtor in the future. There is therefore a need to go beyond matters of judicial cooperation and to establish substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs. (13) This Directive should be without prejudice to the scope of Regulation (EU) 2015/848. It aims to be fully compatible with, and complementary to, that Regulation, by requiring Member States to put in place preventive restructuring procedures which comply with certain minimum principles of effectiveness. It does not change the approach taken in that Regulation of allowing Member States to maintain or introduce procedures which do not fulfil the condition of publicity for notification under Annex A to that Regulation. Although this Directive does not require that procedures within its scope fulfil all the conditions for notification under that Annex, it aims to facilitate the cross-border recognition of those procedures and the recognition and enforceability of judgments. (14) The advantage of the application of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 is that it provides for safeguards against abusive relocation of the debtor's centre of main interests during cross-border insolvency proceedings. Certain restrictions should also apply to procedures not covered by that Regulation. (15) It is necessary to lower the costs of restructuring for both debtors and creditors. Therefore, the differences between Member States which hamper the early restructuring of viable debtors in financial difficulties and the possibility of a discharge of debt for honest entrepreneurs should be reduced. Reducing such differences should bring greater transparency, legal certainty and predictability across the Union. It should maximise the returns to all types of creditors and investors and encourage cross-border investment. Greater coherence of restructuring and insolvency procedures should also facilitate the restructuring of groups of companies irrespective of where the members of the group are located in the Union. (16) Removing the barriers to effective preventive restructuring of viable debtors in financial difficulties contributes to minimising job losses and losses of value for creditors in the supply chain, preserves know-how and skills and hence benefits the wider economy. Facilitating a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs would help to avoid their exclusion from the labour market and enable them to restart entrepreneurial activities, drawing lessons from past experience. Moreover, reducing the length of restructuring procedures would result in higher recovery rates for creditors as the passing of time would normally only result in a further loss of value of the debtor or the debtor's business. Finally, efficient preventive restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures would enable a better assessment of the risks involved in lending and borrowing decisions and facilitate the adjustment for insolvent or over-indebted debtors, minimising the economic and social costs involved in their deleveraging process. This Directive should allow Member States flexibility to apply common principles while respecting national legal systems. Member States should be able to maintain or introduce in their national legal systems preventive restructuring frameworks other than those provided for by this Directive. (17) Enterprises, and in particular SMEs, which represent 99 % of all businesses in the Union, should benefit from a more coherent approach at Union level. SMEs are more likely to be liquidated than restructured, since they have to bear costs that are disproportionately higher than those faced by larger enterprises. SMEs, especially when facing financial difficulties, often do not have the necessary resources to cope with high restructuring costs and to take advantage of the more efficient restructuring procedures available only in some Member States. In order to help such debtors restructure at low cost, comprehensive check-lists for restructuring plans, adapted to the needs and specificities of SMEs, should be developed at national level and made available online. In addition, early warning tools should be put in place to warn debtors of the urgent need to act, taking into account the limited resources of SMEs for hiring experts. (18) When defining SMEs, Member States could give due consideration to Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) or the Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (6). (19) It is appropriate to exclude from the scope of this Directive debtors which are insurance and re-insurance undertakings as defined in points (1) and (4) of Article 13 of Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), credit institutions as defined in point (1) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), investment firms and collective investment undertakings as defined in points (2) and (7) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, central counterparties as defined in point (1) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), central securities depositories as defined in point (1) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) and other financial institutions and entities listed in the first subparagraph of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (11). Such debtors are subject to special arrangements and the national supervisory and resolution authorities have wide-ranging powers of intervention in relation to them. Member States should be able to exclude other financial entities providing financial services which are subject to comparable arrangements and powers of intervention. (20) For similar considerations, it is also appropriate to exclude from the scope of this Directive public bodies under national law. Member States should also be able to limit the access to preventive restructuring frameworks to legal persons, since the financial difficulties of entrepreneurs may be efficiently addressed not only by means of preventive restructuring procedures but also by means of procedures which lead to a discharge of debt or by means of informal restructurings based on contractual agreements. Member States with different legal systems, where the same type of entity has a different legal status in those legal systems, should be able to apply one uniform regime to such entities. A preventive restructuring framework laid down pursuant to this Directive should not affect claims and entitlements against a debtor that arise from occupational pension systems if those claims and entitlements accrued during a period prior to the restructuring. (21) Consumer over-indebtedness is a matter of great economic and social concern and is closely related to the reduction of debt overhang. Furthermore, it is often not possible to draw a clear distinction between the debts incurred by entrepreneurs in the course of their trade, business, craft or profession and those incurred outside those activities. Entrepreneurs would not effectively benefit from a second chance if they had to go through separate procedures, with different access conditions and discharge periods, to discharge their business debts and other debts incurred outside their business. For those reasons, although this Directive does not include binding rules on consumer over-indebtedness, it would be advisable for Member States to apply also to consumers, at the earliest opportunity, the provisions of this Directive concerning discharge of debt. (22) The earlier a debtor can detect its financial difficulties and can take appropriate action, the higher the probability of avoiding an impending insolvency or, in the case of a business the viability of which is permanently impaired, the more orderly and efficient the liquidation process would be. Clear, up-to-date, concise and user-friendly information on the available preventive restructuring procedures as well as one or more early warning tools should therefore be put in place to incentivise debtors that start to experience financial difficulties to take early action. Early warning tools which take the form of alert mechanisms that indicate when the debtor has not made certain types of payments could be triggered by, for example, non-payment of taxes or social security contributions. Such tools could be developed either by Member States or by private entities, provided that the objective is met. Member States should make information about early warning tools available online, for example on a dedicated website or webpage. Member States should be able to adapt the early warning tools depending on the size of the enterprise and to lay down specific provisions on early warning tools for large-sized enterprises and groups that take into account their peculiarities. This Directive should not impose any liability on Member States for potential damage incurred through restructuring procedures which are triggered by such early warning tools. (23) In an effort to increase the support of employees and their representatives, Member States should ensure that employees' representatives are given access to relevant and up-to-date information regarding the availability of early warning tools and it should also be possible for them to provide support to employees' representatives in assessing the economic situation of the debtor. (24) A restructuring framework should be available to debtors, including legal entities and, where so provided under national law, natural persons and groups of companies, to enable them to address their financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that their insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. A restructuring framework should be available before a debtor becomes insolvent under national law, namely before the debtor fulfils the conditions under national law for entering collective insolvency proceedings, which normally entail a total divestment of the debtor and the appointment of a liquidator. In order to avoid restructuring frameworks being misused, the financial difficulties of the debtor should indicate a likelihood of insolvency and the restructuring plan should be capable of preventing the insolvency of the debtor and ensuring the viability of the business. (25) Member States should be able to determine whether claims that fall due or that come into existence after an application to open a preventive restructuring procedure has been submitted or after the procedure has been opened are included in the preventive restructuring measures or the stay of individual enforcement actions. Member States should be able to decide whether the stay of individual enforcement actions has an effect on the interest due on claims. (26) Member States should be able to introduce a viability test as a condition for access to the preventive restructuring procedure provided for by this Directive. Such a test should be carried out without detriment to the debtor's assets, which could take the form of, among other things, the granting of an interim stay or the carrying out without undue delay of the test. However, the absence of detriment should not prevent Member States from requiring debtors to prove their viability at their own cost. (27) The fact that Member States can limit access to a restructuring framework with regard to debtors that have been sentenced for serious breaches of accounting or book-keeping obligations should not prevent Member States from also limiting the access of debtors to preventive restructuring frameworks where their books and records are incomplete or deficient to a degree that makes it impossible to ascertain the business and financial situation of the debtors. (28) Member States should be able to extend the scope of preventive restructuring frameworks provided for by this Directive to situations in which debtors face non-financial difficulties, provided that such difficulties give rise to a real and serious threat to a debtor's actual or future ability to pay its debts as they fall due. The time frame relevant for the determination of such threat may extend to a period of several months, or even longer, in order to account for cases in which the debtor is faced with non-financial difficulties threatening the status of its business as a going concern and, in the medium term, its liquidity. This may be the case, for example, where the debtor has lost a contract which is of key importance to it. (29) To promote efficiency and reduce delays and costs, national preventive restructuring frameworks should include flexible procedures. Where this Directive is implemented by means of more than one procedure within a restructuring framework, the debtor should have access to all rights and safeguards provided for by this Directive with the aim of achieving an effective restructuring. Except in the event of mandatory involvement of judicial or administrative authorities as provided for under this Directive, Member States should be able to limit the involvement of such authorities to situations in which it is necessary and proportionate, while taking into consideration, among other things, the aim of safeguarding the rights and interests of debtors and of affected parties, as well as the aim of reducing delays and the cost of the procedures. Where creditors or employees' representatives are allowed to initiate a restructuring procedure under national law and where the debtor is an SME, Member States should require the agreement of the debtor as a precondition for the initiation of the procedure, and should also be able to extend that requirement to debtors which are large enterprises. (30) To avoid unnecessary costs, to reflect the early nature of preventive restructuring and to encourage debtors to apply for preventive restructuring at an early stage of their financial difficulties, they should, in principle, be left in control of their assets and the day-to-day operation of their business. The appointment of a practitioner in the field of restructuring, to supervise the activity of a debtor or to partially take over control of a debtor's daily operations, should not be mandatory in every case, but made on a case-by-case basis depending on the circumstances of the case or on the debtor's specific needs. Nevertheless, Member States should be able to determine that the appointment of a practitioner in the field of restructuring is always necessary in certain circumstances, such as where: the debtor benefits from a general stay of individual enforcement actions; the restructuring plan needs to be confirmed by means of a cross-class cram-down; the restructuring plan includes measures affecting the rights of workers; or the debtor or its management have acted in a criminal, fraudulent, or detrimental manner in business relations. (31) For the purpose of assisting the parties with negotiating and drafting a restructuring plan, Member States should provide for the mandatory appointment of a practitioner in the field of restructuring where: a judicial or administrative authority grants the debtor a general stay of individual enforcement actions, provided that in such case a practitioner is needed to safeguard the interests of the parties; the restructuring plan needs to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority by means of a cross-class cram-down; it was requested by the debtor; or it is requested by a majority of creditors provided that the creditors cover the costs and fees of the practitioner. (32) A debtor should be able to benefit from a temporary stay of individual enforcement actions, whether granted by a judicial or administrative authority or by operation of law, with the aim of supporting the negotiations on a restructuring plan, in order to be able to continue operating or at least to preserve the value of its estate during the negotiations. Where so provided by national law, it should also be possible for the stay to apply for the benefit of third-party security providers, including guarantors and collateral givers. However, Member States should be able to provide that judicial or administrative authorities can refuse to grant a stay of individual enforcement actions where such a stay is not necessary or where it would not fulfil the objective of supporting the negotiations. Grounds for refusal might include a lack of support by the required majorities of creditors or, where so provided under national law, the debtor's actual inability to pay debts as they fall due. (33) In order to facilitate and accelerate the course of proceedings, Member States should be able to establish, on a rebuttable basis, presumptions for the presence of grounds for refusal of the stay, where, for example, the debtor shows conduct that is typical of a debtor that is unable to pay debts as they fall due  such as a substantial default vis-Ã -vis workers or tax or social security agencies  or where a financial crime has been committed by the debtor or the current management of an enterprise which gives reason to believe that a majority of creditors would not support the start of the negotiations. (34) A stay of individual enforcement actions could be general, in that it affects all creditors, or it could apply only to some individual creditors or categories of creditors. Member States should be able to exclude certain claims or categories of claims from the scope of the stay, in well-defined circumstances, such as claims which are secured by assets the removal of which would not jeopardise the restructuring of the business or claims of creditors in respect of which a stay would cause unfair prejudice, such as by way of an uncompensated loss or depreciation of collateral. (35) In order to provide for a fair balance between the rights of the debtor and those of creditors, a stay of individual enforcement actions should apply for a maximum period of up to four months. Complex restructurings may, however, require more time. Member States should be able to provide that, in such cases, extensions of the initial period of the stay can be granted by the judicial or administrative authority. Where a judicial or administrative authority does not take a decision on the extension of a stay before it lapses, the stay should cease to have effect upon expiry of the stay period. In the interest of legal certainty, the total period of the stay should be limited to 12 months. Member States should be able to provide for an indefinite stay where the debtor becomes insolvent under national law. Member States should be able to decide whether a short interim stay pending a judicial or administrative authority's decision on access to the preventive restructuring framework is subject to the time limits under this Directive. (36) To ensure that creditors do not suffer unnecessary detriment, Member States should provide that judicial or administrative authorities can lift a stay of individual enforcement actions if it no longer fulfils the objective of supporting negotiations, for example if it becomes apparent that the required majority of creditors does not support the continuation of the negotiations. The stay should also be lifted if creditors are unfairly prejudiced by it, where Member States provide for such a possibility. Member States should be allowed to limit the possibility to lift the stay to situations where creditors have not had the opportunity to be heard before it came into force or before it was extended. Member States should also be allowed to provide for a minimum period during which the stay cannot be lifted. In establishing whether there is unfair prejudice to creditors, judicial or administrative authorities should be able to take into account whether the stay would preserve the overall value of the estate, and whether the debtor acts in bad faith or with the intention of causing prejudice or generally acts against the legitimate expectations of the general body of creditors. (37) This Directive does not cover provisions on compensation or guarantees for creditors of which the collateral is likely to decrease in value during the stay. A single creditor or a class of creditors would be unfairly prejudiced by the stay if, for example, their claims would be made substantially worse-off as a result of the stay than if the stay did not apply, or if the creditor is put more at a disadvantage than other creditors in a similar position. Member States should be able to provide that, whenever unfair prejudice is established in respect of one or more creditors or one or more classes of creditors, the stay can be lifted in respect of those creditors or classes of creditors or in respect of all creditors. Member States should be able to decide who is entitled to request the lifting of the stay. (38) A stay of individual enforcement actions should also result in the suspension of a debtor's obligation to file for, or the opening at a creditor's request of, an insolvency procedure which could end in liquidation of the debtor. Such insolvency procedures should, in addition to those limited by law to having as the only possible outcome the liquidation of the debtor, also include procedures that could lead to a restructuring of the debtor. The suspension of the opening of an insolvency procedure at the request of creditors should apply not only where Member States provide for a general stay of individual enforcement actions covering all creditors, but also where Member States provide for the option of a stay of individual enforcement actions covering only a limited number of creditors. Nevertheless, Member States should be able to provide that insolvency proceedings can be opened at the request of public authorities which are not acting in a creditor capacity, but in the general interest, such as a public prosecutor. (39) This Directive should not prevent debtors from paying, in the ordinary course of business, claims of unaffected creditors, and claims of affected creditors that arise during the stay of individual enforcement actions. To ensure that creditors with claims that came into existence before the opening of a restructuring procedure or a stay of individual enforcement actions do not put pressure on the debtor to pay those claims, which otherwise would be reduced through the implementation of the restructuring plan, Member States should be able to provide for the suspension of the obligation on the debtor with respect to payment of those claims. (40) When a debtor enters an insolvency procedure, some suppliers can have contractual rights, provided for in so-called ipso facto clauses, entitling them to terminate the supply contract solely on account of the insolvency, even if the debtor has duly met its obligations. Ipso facto clauses could also be triggered when a debtor applies for preventive restructuring measures. Where such clauses are invoked when the debtor is merely negotiating a restructuring plan or requesting a stay of individual enforcement actions or invoked in connection with any event connected with the stay, early termination can have a negative impact on the debtor's business and the successful rescue of the business. Therefore, in such cases, it is necessary to provide that creditors are not allowed to invoke ipso facto clauses which make reference to negotiations on a restructuring plan or a stay or any similar event connected to the stay. (41) Early termination can endanger the ability of a business to continue operating during restructuring negotiations, especially when contracts for essential supplies such as gas, electricity, water, telecommunication and card payment services are concerned. Member States should provide that creditors to which a stay of individual enforcement actions applies, and whose claims came into existence prior to the stay and have not been paid by a debtor, are not allowed to withhold performance of, terminate, accelerate or, in any other way, modify essential executory contracts during the stay period, provided that the debtor complies with its obligations under such contracts which fall due during the stay. Executory contracts are, for example, lease and licence agreements, long-term supply contracts and franchise agreements. (42) This Directive lays down minimum standards for the content of a restructuring plan. However, Member States should be able to require additional explanations in the restructuring plan, concerning for example the criteria according to which creditors have been grouped, which may be relevant in cases where a debt is only partially secured. Member States should not be obliged to require an expert opinion regarding the value of assets which need to be indicated in the plan. (43) Creditors affected by a restructuring plan, including workers, and, where allowed under national law, equity-holders, should have a right to vote on the adoption of a restructuring plan. Member States should be able to provide for limited exceptions to this rule. Parties unaffected by the restructuring plan should have no voting rights in relation to the plan, nor should their support be required for the approval of any plan. The concept of affected parties should only include workers in their capacity as creditors. Therefore, if Member States decide to exempt the claims of workers from the preventive restructuring framework, workers should not be considered as affected parties. The vote on the adoption of a restructuring plan could take the form of a formal voting process or of a consultation and agreement with the required majority of affected parties. However, where the vote takes the form of an agreement with the requisite majority, affected parties which were not involved in the agreement could nevertheless be offered the opportunity to join the restructuring plan. (44) To ensure that rights which are substantially similar are treated equitably and that restructuring plans can be adopted without unfairly prejudicing the rights of affected parties, affected parties should be treated in separate classes which correspond to the class formation criteria under national law. Class formation means the grouping of affected parties for the purposes of adopting a plan in such a way as to reflect their rights and the seniority of their claims and interests. As a minimum, secured and unsecured creditors should always be treated in separate classes. Member States should, however, be able to require that more than two classes of creditors are formed, including different classes of unsecured or secured creditors and classes of creditors with subordinated claims. Member States should also be able to treat types of creditors that lack a sufficient commonality of interest, such as tax or social security authorities, in separate classes. It should be possible for Member States to provide that secured claims can be divided into secured and unsecured parts based on collateral valuation. It should also be possible for Member States to lay down specific rules supporting class formation where non-diversified or otherwise especially vulnerable creditors, such as workers or small suppliers, would benefit from such class formation. (45) Member States should be able to provide that debtors that are SMEs, can, on account of their relatively simple capital structure, be exempted from the obligation to treat affected parties in separate classes. In cases where SMEs have opted to create only one voting class and that class votes against the plan, it should be possible for debtors to submit another plan, in line with the general principles of this Directive. (46) Member States should in any case ensure that adequate treatment is given in their national law to matters of particular importance for class formation purposes, such as claims from connected parties, and that their national law contains rules that deal with contingent claims and contested claims. Member States should be allowed to regulate how contested claims are to be handled for the purposes of allocating voting rights. The judicial or administrative authority should examine class formation, including the selection of creditors affected by the plan, when a restructuring plan is submitted for confirmation. However, Member States should be able to provide that such authority can also examine class formation at an earlier stage should the proposer of the plan seek validation or guidance in advance. (47) Requisite majorities should be established by national law to ensure that a minority of affected parties in each class cannot obstruct the adoption of a restructuring plan which does not unfairly reduce their rights and interests. Without a majority rule binding dissenting secured creditors, early restructuring would not be possible in many cases, for example where a financial restructuring is needed but the business is otherwise viable. To ensure that parties have a say on the adoption of restructuring plans proportionate to the stakes they have in the business, the required majority should be based on the amount of the creditors' claims or equity holders' interests in any given class. Member States should, in addition, be able to require a majority in the number of affected parties in each class. Member States should be able to lay down rules in relation to affected parties with a right to vote which do not exercise that right in a correct manner or are not represented, such as rules allowing those affected parties to be taken into account for a participation threshold or for the calculation of a majority. Member States should also be able to provide for a participation threshold for the vote. (48) Confirmation of a restructuring plan by a judicial or administrative authority is necessary to ensure that the reduction of the rights of creditors or interests of equity holders is proportionate to the benefits of the restructuring and that they have access to an effective remedy. Confirmation is particularly necessary where: there are dissenting affected parties; the restructuring plan contains provisions on new financing; or the plan involves a loss of more than 25 % of the work force. Member States should, however, be able to provide that confirmation by a judicial or administrative authority is necessary also in other cases. A confirmation of a plan which involves the loss of more than 25 % of the work force should only be necessary where national law allows preventive restructuring frameworks to provide for measures that have a direct effect on employment contracts. (49) Member States should ensure that a judicial or administrative authority is able to reject a plan where it has been established that it reduces the rights of dissenting creditors or equity holders either to a level below what they could reasonably expect to receive in the event of the liquidation of the debtor's business, whether by piecemeal liquidation or by a sale as a going concern, depending on the particular circumstances of each debtor, or to a level below what they could reasonably expect in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario where the restructuring plan is not confirmed. However, where the plan is confirmed through a cross-class cram-down, reference should be made to the protection mechanism used in such scenario. Where Member States opt to carry out a valuation of the debtor as a going concern, the going-concern value should take into account the debtor's business in the longer term, as opposed to the liquidation value. The going-concern value is, as a rule, higher than the liquidation value because it is based on the assumption that the business continues its activity with the minimum of disruption, has the confidence of financial creditors, shareholders and clients, continues to generate revenues, and limits the impact on workers. (50) While compliance with the best-interests-of-creditors test should be examined by a judicial or administrative authority only if the restructuring plan is challenged on that ground in order to avoid a valuation being made in every case, Member States should be able to provide that other conditions for confirmation can be examined ex officio. Member States should be able to add other conditions which need to be complied with in order to confirm a restructuring plan, such as whether equity holders are adequately protected. Judicial or administrative authorities should be able to refuse to confirm restructuring plans which have no reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency of the debtor or ensuring the viability of the business. However, Member States should not be required to ensure that such assessment is made ex officio. (51) Notification to all affected parties should be one of the conditions for confirmation of a restructuring plan. Member States should be able to define the form of the notification, to identify the time when it is to be made, as well as to lay down provisions for the treatment of unknown claims as regards notification. They should also be able to provide that non-affected parties have to be informed about the restructuring plan. (52) Satisfying the best-interest-of-creditors test should be considered to mean that no dissenting creditor is worse off under a restructuring plan than it would be either in the case of liquidation, whether piecemeal liquidation or sale of the business as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the restructuring plan were not to be confirmed. Member States should be able to choose one of those thresholds when implementing the best-interest-of-creditors test in national law. That test should be applied in any case where a plan needs to be confirmed in order to be binding for dissenting creditors or, as the case may be, dissenting classes of creditors. As a consequence of the best-interest-of-creditors test, where public institutional creditors have a privileged status under national law, Member States could provide that the plan cannot impose a full or partial cancellation of the claims of those creditors. (53) While a restructuring plan should always be adopted if the required majority in each affected class supports the plan, it should still be possible for a restructuring plan which is not supported by the required majority in each affected class to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority, upon the proposal of a debtor or with the debtor's agreement. In the case of a legal person, Member States should be able to decide if, for the purpose of adopting or confirming a restructuring plan, the debtor is to be understood as the legal person's management board or a certain majority of shareholders or equity holders. For the plan to be confirmed in the case of a cross-class cram-down, it should be supported by a majority of voting classes of affected parties. At least one of those classes should be a secured creditor class or senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors class. (54) It should be possible that, where a majority of voting classes does not support the restructuring plan, the plan can nevertheless be confirmed if it is supported by at least one affected or impaired class of creditors which, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going concern, receive payment or keep any interest, or, where so provided under national law, can reasonably be presumed to receive payment or keep any interest, if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities is applied under national law. In such a case, Member States should be able to increase the number of classes which are required to approve the plan, without necessarily requiring that all those classes should, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going concern, receive payment or keep any interest under national law. However, Member States should not require the consent of all classes. Accordingly, where there are only two classes of creditors, the consent of at least one class should be deemed to be sufficient, if the other conditions for the application of a cross-class cram-down are met. The impairment of creditors should be understood to mean that there is a reduction in the value of their claims. (55) In the case of a cross-class cram-down, Member States should ensure that dissenting classes of affected creditors are not unfairly prejudiced under the proposed plan and Member States should provide sufficient protection for such dissenting classes. Member States should be able to protect a dissenting class of affected creditors by ensuring that it is treated at least as favourably as any other class of the same rank and more favourably than any more junior class. Alternatively, Member States could protect a dissenting class of affected creditors by ensuring that such dissenting class is paid in full if a more junior class receives any distribution or keeps any interest under the restructuring plan (the absolute priority rule). Member States should have discretion in implementing the concept of payment in full, including in relation to the timing of the payment, as long as the principal of the claim and, in the case of secured creditors, the value of the collateral are protected. Member States should also be able to decide on the choice of the equivalent means by which the original claim could be satisfied in full. (56) Member States should be able to derogate from the absolute priority rule, for example where it is considered fair that equity holders keep certain interests under the plan despite a more senior class being obliged to accept a reduction of its claims, or that essential suppliers covered by the provision on the stay of individual enforcement actions are paid before more senior classes of creditors. Member States should be able to choose which of the above-mentioned protection mechanisms they put in place. (57) While shareholders' or other equity holders' legitimate interests should be protected, Member States should ensure that they cannot unreasonably prevent the adoption of restructuring plans that would bring the debtor back to viability. Member States should be able to use different means to achieve that goal, for example by not giving equity holders the right to vote on a restructuring plan and by not making the adoption of a restructuring plan conditional on the agreement of equity holders that, upon a valuation of the enterprise, would not receive any payment or other consideration if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied. However, where equity holders have the right to vote on a restructuring plan, a judicial or administrative authority should be able to confirm the plan by applying the rules on cross-class cram down notwithstanding the dissent of one or more classes of equity holders. Member States that exclude equity holders from voting should not be required to apply the absolute priority rule in the relationship between creditors and equity holders. Another possible means of ensuring that equity holders do not unreasonably prevent the adoption of restructuring plans would be to ensure that restructuring measures that directly affect equity holders' rights, and that need to be approved by a general meeting of shareholders under company law, are not subject to unreasonably high majority requirements and that equity holders have no competence in terms of restructuring measures that do not directly affect their rights. (58) Several classes of equity holders can be needed where different classes of shareholdings with different rights exist. Equity holders of SMEs that are not mere investors, but are the owners of the enterprise and contribute to the enterprise in other ways, such as managerial expertise, might not have an incentive to restructure under such conditions. For this reason, the cross-class cram-down should remain optional for debtors that are SMEs. (59) The restructuring plan should, for the purposes of its implementation, make it possible for equity holders of SMEs to provide non-monetary restructuring assistance by drawing on, for example, their experience, reputation or business contacts. (60) Throughout the preventive restructuring procedures, workers should enjoy full labour law protection. In particular, this Directive should be without prejudice to workers' rights guaranteed by Council Directives 98/59/EC (12) and 2001/23/EC (13), and Directives 2002/14/EC (14), 2008/94/EC (15) and 2009/38/EC (16) of the European Parliament and of the Council. The obligations concerning information and consultation of employees under national law transposing those Directives remain fully intact. This includes obligations to inform and consult employees' representatives on the decision to have recourse to a preventive restructuring framework in accordance with Directive 2002/14/EC. (61) Employees and their representatives should be provided with information regarding the proposed restructuring plan in so far as provided for in Union law, in order to allow them to undertake an in-depth assessment of the various scenarios. Furthermore, employees and their representatives should be involved to the extent necessary to fulfil the consultation requirements laid down in Union law. Given the need to ensure an appropriate level of protection of workers, Member States should be required to exempt workers' outstanding claims from any stay of individual enforcement actions, irrespective of the question of whether those claims arise before or after the stay is granted. A stay of enforcement of workers' outstanding claims should be allowed only for the amounts and for the period for which the payment of such claims is effectively guaranteed at a similar level by other means under national law. Where national law provides for limitations on the liability of guarantee institutions, either in terms of the length of the guarantee or the amount paid to workers, workers should be able to enforce any shortfall in their claims against the employer even during the stay period. Alternatively, Member States should be able to exclude workers' claims from the scope of the preventive restructuring frameworks and provide for their protection under national law. (62) Where a restructuring plan entails the transfer of a part of an undertaking or business, workers' rights arising from a contract of employment or from an employment relationship, in particular the right to wages, should be safeguarded in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of Directive 2001/23/EC, without prejudice to the specific rules applying in the event of insolvency proceedings under Article 5 of that Directive and in particular the possibilities provided for in Article 5(2) of that Directive. This Directive should be without prejudice to the rights to information and consultation, which are guaranteed by Directive 2002/14/EC, including on decisions likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations with a view to reaching an agreement on such decisions. Furthermore, under this Directive, workers whose claims are affected by a restructuring plan should have the right to vote on the plan. For the purposes of voting on the restructuring plan, Member States should be able to decide to place workers in a class separate from other classes of creditors. (63) Judicial or administrative authorities should only decide on the valuation of a business  either in liquidation or in the next-best-alternative scenario, if the restructuring plan was not confirmed  if a dissenting affected party challenges the restructuring plan. This should not prevent Member States from carrying out valuations in another context under national law. However, it should be possible that such a decision also consists of an approval of a valuation by an expert or of a valuation submitted by the debtor or another party at an earlier stage of the process. Where the decision to carry out a valuation is taken, Member States should be able to provide for special rules, separate from general civil procedural law, for a valuation in restructuring cases, with a view to ensuring that it is carried out in an expedited manner. Nothing in this Directive should affect the rules on burden of proof under national law in the case of a valuation. (64) The binding effects of a restructuring plan should be limited to the affected parties that were involved in the adoption of the plan. Member States should be able to determine what it means for a creditor to be involved, including in the case of unknown creditors or creditors of future claims. For example, Member States should be able to decide how to deal with creditors that have been notified correctly but that did not participate in the procedures. (65) Interested affected parties should be able to appeal a decision on the confirmation of a restructuring plan issued by an administrative authority. Member States should also be able to introduce the option of appealing a decision on the confirmation of a restructuring plan issued by a judicial authority. However, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the plan, to reduce uncertainty and to avoid unjustifiable delays, appeals should, as a rule, not have suspensive effects and therefore not preclude the implementation of a restructuring plan. Member States should be able to determine and limit the grounds for appeal. Where the decision on the confirmation of the plan is appealed, Member States should be able to allow the judicial authority to issue a preliminary or summary decision that protects the execution and implementation of the plan against the consequences of the pending appeal being upheld. Where an appeal is upheld, judicial or administrative authorities should be able to consider, as an alternative to setting aside the plan, an amendment of the plan, where Member States provide for such a possibility, as well as a confirmation of the plan without amendments. It should be possible for any amendments to the plan to be proposed or voted on by the parties, on their own initiative or at the request of the judicial authority. Member States could also provide for compensation for monetary losses for the party whose appeal was upheld. National law should be able to deal with a potential new stay or extension of the stay in event of the judicial authority deciding that the appeal has suspensive effect. (66) The success of a restructuring plan often depends on whether financial assistance is extended to the debtor to support, firstly, the operation of the business during restructuring negotiations and, secondly, the implementation of the restructuring plan after its confirmation. Financial assistance should be understood in a broad sense, including the provision of money or third-party guarantees and the supply of stock, inventory, raw materials and utilities, for example through granting the debtor a longer repayment period. Interim financing and new financing should therefore be exempt from avoidance actions which seek to declare such financing void, voidable or unenforceable as an act detrimental to the general body of creditors in the context of subsequent insolvency procedures. (67) National insolvency laws providing for avoidance actions of interim and new financing or providing that new lenders may incur civil, administrative or criminal sanctions for extending credit to debtors in financial difficulties could jeopardise the availability of financing necessary for the successful negotiation and implementation of a restructuring plan. This Directive should be without prejudice to other grounds for declaring new or interim financing void, voidable or unenforceable, or for triggering civil, criminal or administrative liability for providers of such financing, as laid down in national law. Such other grounds could include, among other things, fraud, bad faith, a certain type of relationship between the parties which could be associated with a conflict of interest, such as in the case of transactions between related parties or between shareholders and the company, and transactions where a party received value or collateral without being entitled to it at the time of the transaction or in the manner performed. (68) When interim financing is extended, the parties do not know whether the restructuring plan will be eventually confirmed or not. Therefore, Member States should not be required to limit the protection of interim finance to cases where the plan is adopted by creditors or confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority. To avoid potential abuses, only financing that is reasonably and immediately necessary for the continued operation or survival of the debtor's business or the preservation or enhancement of the value of that business pending the confirmation of that plan should be protected. Furthermore, this Directive should not prevent Member States from introducing an ex ante control mechanism for interim financing. Member States should be able to limit the protection for new financing to cases where the plan is confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority and for interim financing to cases where it is subject to ex ante control. An ex ante control mechanism for interim financing or other transactions could be exercised by a practitioner in the field of restructuring, by a creditor's committee or by a judicial or administrative authority. Protection from avoidance actions and protection from personal liability are minimum guarantees that should be granted to interim financing and new financing. However, encouraging new lenders to take the enhanced risk of investing in a viable debtor in financial difficulties could require further incentives such as, for example, giving such financing priority at least over unsecured claims in subsequent insolvency procedures. (69) In order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring, it is desirable that transactions which are reasonable and immediately necessary for the negotiation or implementation of a restructuring plan also be given protection from avoidance actions in subsequent insolvency procedures. Judicial or administrative authorities should be able, when determining the reasonableness and immediate necessity of costs and fees, for instance, to consider projections and estimates submitted to affected parties, a creditor's committee, a practitioner in the field of restructuring or the judicial or administrative authority itself. To this end, Member States should also be able to require debtors to provide and update relevant estimates. Such protection should enhance certainty in respect of transactions with businesses that are known to be in financial difficulties and remove the fear of creditors and investors that all such transactions could be declared void in the event that the restructuring fails. Member States should be able to provide for a point in time prior to the opening of a preventive restructuring procedure and to the granting of the stay of individual enforcement actions, from which fees and costs of negotiating, adopting, confirming or seeking professional advice for the restructuring plan start to benefit from protection against avoidance actions. In the case of other payments and disbursements and the protection of the payment of workers' wages, such a starting point could also be the granting of the stay or the opening of the preventive restructuring procedure. (70) To further promote preventive restructuring, it is important to ensure that directors are not dissuaded from exercising reasonable business judgment or taking reasonable commercial risks, particularly where to do so would improve the chances of a restructuring of potentially viable businesses. Where the company experiences financial difficulties, directors should take steps to minimise losses and to avoid insolvency, such as: seeking professional advice, including on restructuring and insolvency, for instance by making use of early warning tools where applicable; protecting the assets of the company so as to maximise value and avoid loss of key assets; considering the structure and functions of the business to examine viability and reduce expenditure; refraining from committing the company to the types of transaction that might be subject to avoidance unless there is an appropriate business justification; continuing to trade in circumstances where it is appropriate to do so in order to maximise going-concern value; holding negotiations with creditors and entering preventive restructuring procedures. (71) Where the debtor is close to insolvency, it is also important to protect the legitimate interests of creditors from management decisions that may have an impact on the constitution of the debtor's estate, in particular where those decisions could have the effect of further diminishing the value of the estate available for restructuring efforts or for distribution to creditors. It is therefore necessary to ensure that, in such circumstances, directors avoid any deliberate or grossly negligent actions that result in personal gain at the expense of stakeholders, and avoid agreeing to transactions at below market value, or taking actions leading to unfair preference being given to one or more stakeholders. Member States should be able to implement the corresponding provisions of this Directive by ensuring that judicial or administrative authorities, when assessing whether a director is to be held liable for breaches of duty of care, take the rules on duties of directors laid down in this Directive into account. This Directive is not intended to establish any hierarchy among the different parties whose interests need to be given due regard. However, Member States should be able to decide on establishing such a hierarchy. This Directive should be without prejudice to Member States' national rules on the decision-making processes in a company. (72) Entrepreneurs exercising a trade, business, craft or independent, self-employed profession can run the risk of becoming insolvent. The differences between the Member States in terms of opportunities for a fresh start could incentivise over-indebted or insolvent entrepreneurs to relocate to a Member State other than the Member State where they are established, in order to benefit from shorter discharge periods or more attractive conditions for discharge, leading to additional legal uncertainty and costs for the creditors when recovering their claims. Furthermore, the effects of insolvency, in particular the social stigma, the legal consequences, such as disqualifying entrepreneurs from taking up and pursuing entrepreneurial activity, and the continual inability to pay off debts, constitute important disincentives for entrepreneurs seeking to set up a business or have a second chance, even if evidence shows that entrepreneurs who have become insolvent have more chances of being successful the next time. (73) Steps should therefore be taken to reduce the negative effects of over-indebtedness or insolvency on entrepreneurs, in particular by allowing for a full discharge of debt after a certain period of time and by limiting the length of disqualification orders issued in connection with a debtor's over-indebtedness or insolvency. The concept of insolvency should be defined by national law and it could take the form of over-indebtedness. The concept of entrepreneur within the meaning of this Directive should have no bearing on the position of managers or directors of a company, which should be treated in accordance with national law. Member States should be able to decide how to obtain access to discharge, including the possibility of requiring the debtor to request discharge. (74) Member States should be able to provide for the possibility to adjust the repayment obligations of insolvent entrepreneurs when there is a significant change in their financial situation, regardless of whether it improves or deteriorates. This Directive should not require that a repayment plan be supported by a majority of creditors. Member States should be able to provide that entrepreneurs are not prevented from starting a new activity in the same or different field during the implementation of the repayment plan. (75) A discharge of debt should be available in procedures that include a repayment plan, a realisation of assets, or a combination of both. In implementing those rules, Member States should be able to choose freely among those options. If more than one procedure leading to discharge of debt is available under national law, Member States should ensure that at least one of those procedures gives insolvent entrepreneurs the opportunity of having a full discharge of debt within a period that does not exceed three years. In the case of procedures which combine a realisation of assets and a repayment plan, the discharge period should start, at the latest, from the date the repayment plan is confirmed by a court or starts being implemented, for example from the first instalment under the plan, but it could also start earlier, such as when a decision to open the procedure is taken. (76) In procedures that do not include a repayment plan, the discharge period should start, at the latest, from the date when a decision to open the procedure is taken by a judicial or administrative authority, or the date of the establishment of the insolvency estate. For the purposes of calculating the duration of the discharge period under this Directive, Member States should be able to provide that the concept of opening of procedure does not include preliminary measures, such as preservation measures or the appointment of a preliminary insolvency practitioner, unless such measures allow for the realisation of assets, including the disposal and the distribution of assets to creditors. The establishment of the insolvency estate should not necessarily entail a formal decision or confirmation by a judicial or administrative authority, where such decision is not required under national law, and could consist in the submission of the inventory of assets and liabilities. (77) Where the procedural path leading to a discharge of debt entails the realisation of an entrepreneur's assets, Member States should not be prevented from providing that the request for discharge is treated separately from the realisation of assets, provided that such request constitutes an integral part of the procedural path leading to the discharge under this Directive. Member States should be able to decide on the rules on the burden of proof in order for the discharge to operate, which means that it should be possible for entrepreneurs to be required by law to prove compliance with their obligations. (78) A full discharge of debt or the ending of disqualifications after a period no longer than three years is not appropriate in all circumstances, therefore derogations from this rule which are duly justified by reasons laid down in national law might need to be introduced. For instance, such derogations should be introduced in cases where the debtor is dishonest or has acted in bad faith. Where entrepreneurs do not benefit from a presumption of honesty and good faith under national law, the burden of proof concerning their honesty and good faith should not make it unnecessarily difficult or onerous for them to enter the procedure. (79) In establishing whether an entrepreneur was dishonest, judicial or administrative authorities might take into account circumstances such as: the nature and extent of the debt; the time when the debt was incurred; the efforts of the entrepreneur to pay the debt and comply with legal obligations, including public licensing requirements and the need for proper bookkeeping; actions on the entrepreneur's part to frustrate recourse by creditors; the fulfilment of duties in the likelihood of insolvency, which are incumbent on entrepreneurs who are directors of a company; and compliance with Union and national competition and labour law. It should also be possible to introduce derogations where the entrepreneur has not complied with certain legal obligations, including obligations to maximise returns to creditors, which could take the form of a general obligation to generate income or assets. It should furthermore be possible to introduce specific derogations where it is necessary to guarantee the balance between the rights of the debtor and the rights of one or more creditors, such as where the creditor is a natural person who needs more protection than the debtor. (80) A derogation could also be justified where the costs of the procedure leading to a discharge of debt, including the fees of judicial and administrative authorities and of practitioners, are not covered. Member States should be able to provide that the benefits of that discharge can be revoked where, for example, the financial situation of the debtor improves significantly due to unexpected circumstances, such as winning a lottery, or coming in the possession of an inheritance or a donation. Member States should not be prevented from providing additional derogations in well-defined circumstances and when duly justified. (81) Where there is a duly justified reason under national law, it could be appropriate to limit the possibility of discharge for certain categories of debt. It should be possible for Member States to exclude secured debts from eligibility for discharge only up to the value of the collateral as determined by national law, while the rest of the debt should be treated as unsecured debt. Member States should be able to exclude further categories of debt when duly justified. (82) Member States should be able to provide that judicial or administrative authorities can verify, either ex officio or at the request of a person with a legitimate interest, whether entrepreneurs have fulfilled the conditions for obtaining a full discharge of debt. (83) If an entrepreneur's permit or licence to carry on a certain craft, business, trade or profession has been denied or revoked as a result of a disqualification order, this Directive should not prevent Member States from requiring the entrepreneur to submit an application for a new permit or licence after the disqualification has expired. Where a Member State authority adopts a decision concerning a specifically supervised activity, it should be possible to also take into account, even after the expiry of the disqualification period, the fact that the insolvent entrepreneur has obtained a discharge of debt in accordance with this Directive. (84) Personal and professional debts that cannot be reasonably separated, for example where an asset is used in the course of the professional activity of the entrepreneur as well as outside that activity, should be treated in a single procedure. Where Member States provide that such debts are subject to different insolvency procedures, coordination of those procedures is needed. This Directive should be without prejudice to Member States being able to choose to treat all the debts of an entrepreneur in a single procedure. Member States in which entrepreneurs are allowed to continue their business on their own account during insolvency proceedings should not be prevented from providing that such entrepreneurs can be made subject to new insolvency proceedings, where such continued business becomes insolvent. (85) It is necessary to maintain and enhance the transparency and predictability of the procedures in delivering outcomes that are favourable to the preservation of businesses and to allowing entrepreneurs to have a second chance or that permit the efficient liquidation of non-viable enterprises. It is also necessary to reduce the excessive length of insolvency procedures in many Member States, which results in legal uncertainty for creditors and investors and low recovery rates. Finally, given the enhanced cooperation mechanisms between courts and practitioners in cross-border cases, set up under Regulation (EU) 2015/848, the professionalism of all actors involved needs to be brought to comparable high levels across the Union. To achieve those objectives, Member States should ensure that members of the judicial and administrative authorities dealing with procedures concerning preventive restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt are suitably trained and have the necessary expertise for their responsibilities. Such training and expertise could be acquired also during the exercise of the duties as a member of a judicial or administrative authority or, prior to appointment to such duties, during the exercise of other relevant duties. (86) Such training and expertise should enable decisions with a potentially significant economic and social impact to be taken in an efficient manner, and should not be understood to mean that members of a judicial authority have to deal exclusively with matters concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt. Member States should ensure that procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt can be carried out in an efficient and expeditious manner. The creation of specialised courts or chambers, or the appointment of specialised judges in accordance with national law, as well as concentrating jurisdiction in a limited number of judicial or administrative authorities would be efficient ways of achieving the objectives of legal certainty and effectiveness of procedures. Member States should not be obliged to require that procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt be prioritised over other procedures. (87) Member States should also ensure that practitioners in the field of restructuring, insolvency, and discharge of debt that are appointed by judicial or administrative authorities (practitioners) are: suitably trained; appointed in a transparent manner with due regard to the need to ensure efficient procedures; supervised when carrying out their tasks; and perform their tasks with integrity. It is important that practitioners adhere to standards for such tasks, such as obtaining insurance for professional liability. Suitable training, qualifications and expertise for practitioners could also be acquired while practising their profession. Member States should not be obliged to provide the necessary training themselves, but this could be provided by, for example, professional associations or other bodies. Insolvency practitioners as defined in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 should be included in the scope of this Directive. (88) This Directive should not prevent Member States from providing that practitioners are chosen by a debtor, by creditors or by a creditors' committee from a list or a pool that is pre-approved by a judicial or administrative authority. In choosing a practitioner, the debtor, the creditors or the creditors' committee could be granted a margin of appreciation as to the practitioner's expertise and experience in general and the demands of the particular case. Debtors who are natural persons could be exempted from such a duty altogether. In cases with cross-border elements, the appointment of the practitioner should take into account, among other things, the practitioner's ability to comply with the obligations, under Regulation (EU) 2015/848, to communicate and cooperate with insolvency practitioners and judicial and administrative authorities from other Member States, as well as their human and administrative resources to deal with potentially complex cases. Member States should not be prevented from providing for a practitioner to be selected by other methods, such as random selection by a software programme, provided that it is ensured that in using those methods due consideration is given to the practitioner's experience and expertise. Member States should be able to decide on the means for objecting to the selection or appointment of a practitioner or for requesting the replacement of the practitioner, for example through a creditors' committee. (89) Practitioners should be subject to oversight and regulatory mechanisms which should include effective measures regarding the accountability of practitioners who have failed in their duties, such as: a reduction in a practitioner's fee; the exclusion from the list or pool of practitioners who can be appointed in insolvency cases; and, where appropriate, disciplinary, administrative or criminal sanctions. Such oversight and regulatory mechanisms should be without prejudice to provisions under national law on civil liability for damages for breach of contractual or non-contractual obligations. Member States should not be required to set up specific authorities or bodies. Member States should ensure that information about the authorities or bodies exercising oversight over practitioners is publicly available. For instance, a mere reference to the judicial or administrative authority should be sufficient as information. It should be possible, in principle, to attain such standards without the need to create new professions or qualifications under national law. Member States should be able to extend the provisions on the training and supervision of practitioners to other practitioners not covered by this Directive. Member States should not be obliged to provide that disputes over remuneration of practitioners are to be prioritised over other procedures. (90) To further reduce the length of procedures, to facilitate better participation of creditors in procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt and to ensure similar conditions among creditors irrespective of where they are located in the Union, Member States should put in place provisions enabling debtors, creditors, practitioners and judicial and administrative authorities to use electronic means of communication. Therefore, it should be possible that procedural steps such as the filing of claims by creditors, the notification of creditors, or the lodging of challenges and appeals, can be carried out by electronic means of communication. Member States should be able to provide that notifications of a creditor can only be performed electronically if the creditor concerned has previously consented to electronic communication. (91) Parties to procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt should not be obliged to use electronic means of communication if such use is not mandatory under national law, without prejudice to Member States being able to establish a mandatory system of electronic filing and service of documents in procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt. Member States should be able to choose the means of electronic communications. Examples of such means could include a purpose-built system for the electronic transmission of such documents or the use of email, without preventing Member States from being able to put in place features to ensure the security of electronic transmissions, such as electronic signature, or trust services, such as electronic registered delivery services, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17). (92) It is important to gather reliable and comparable data on the performance of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt in order to monitor the implementation and application of this Directive. Therefore, Member States should collect and aggregate data that are sufficiently granular to enable an accurate assessment of how the Directive is working in practice and should communicate those data to the Commission. The communication form for the transmission of such data to the Commission should be established by the Commission assisted by a Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18). The form should provide a shortlist of the main outcomes of procedures that are common to all Member States. For example, in the case of a restructuring procedure, those main outcomes could be the following: the plan being confirmed by a court; the plan not being confirmed by a court; the restructuring procedures being converted to liquidation procedures or closed because of the opening of liquidation procedures before the plan was confirmed by a court. Member States should not be required to provide a break-down by types of outcome in respect of the procedures which end before any relevant measures are taken, but could instead provide a common number for all procedures which are declared inadmissible, rejected or withdrawn before being opened. (93) The communication form should provide a list of options which could be taken into account by the Member States when determining the size of a debtor, by reference to one or more of the elements of the definition of SMEs and large enterprises common to all Member States. The list should include the option of determining the size of a debtor based on the number of workers only. The form should: define the elements of average cost and average recovery rates for which Member States should be able to collect data voluntarily; provide guidance on elements which could be taken into account when Member States make use of a sampling technique, for example on sample sizes to ensure representativeness in terms of geographical distribution, size of debtors and industry; and include the opportunity for Member States to provide any additional information available, for example on the total amount of assets and liabilities of debtors. (94) The stability of financial markets relies heavily on financial collateral arrangements, in particular, when collateral security is provided in connection with the participation in designated systems or in central bank operations and when margins are provided to central counterparties. As the value of financial instruments given as collateral security may be very volatile, it is crucial to realise their value quickly before it goes down. Therefore, the provisions of Directives 98/26/EC (19) and 2002/47/EC (20) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should apply notwithstanding the provisions of this Directive. Member States should be allowed to exempt netting arrangements, including close-out netting, from the effects of the stay of individual enforcement actions even in circumstances where they are not covered by Directives 98/26/EC, 2002/47/EC and Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, if such arrangements are enforceable under the laws of the relevant Member State even if insolvency proceedings are opened. This could be the case for a significant number of master agreements widely used in the financial, energy and commodity markets, both by non-financial and financial counterparties. Such arrangements reduce systemic risks especially in derivatives markets. Such arrangements might therefore be exempt from restrictions that insolvency laws impose on executory contracts. Accordingly, Member States should also be allowed to exempt from the effects of the stay of individual enforcement actions statutory netting arrangements, including close-out netting arrangements, which operate upon the opening of insolvency procedures. The amount resulting from the operation of netting arrangements, including close-out netting arrangements should, however, be subject to the stay of individual enforcement actions. (95) Member States that are parties to the Convention on international interests in mobile equipment, signed at Cape Town on 16 November 2001, and its Protocols should be able to continue to comply with their existing international obligations. The provisions of this Directive regarding preventive restructuring frameworks should apply with the derogations necessary to ensure an application of those provisions without prejudice to the application of that Convention and its Protocols. (96) The effectiveness of the process of adoption and implementation of the restructuring plan should not be jeopardised by company law. Therefore, Member States should be able to derogate from the requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21) concerning the obligations to convene a general meeting and to offer on a pre-emptive basis shares to existing shareholders, to the extent and for the period necessary to ensure that shareholders do not frustrate restructuring efforts by abusing their rights under that Directive. For example, Member States might need to derogate from the obligation to convene a general meeting of shareholders or from the normal time periods, for cases where urgent action is to be taken by the management to safeguard the assets of the company, for instance through requesting a stay of individual enforcement actions and when there is a serious and sudden loss of subscribed capital and a likelihood of insolvency. Derogations from company law might also be required when the restructuring plan provides for the emission of new shares which could be offered with priority to creditors as debt-to-equity swaps, or for the reduction of the amount of subscribed capital in the event of a transfer of parts of the undertaking. Such derogations should be limited in time to the extent that Member States consider such derogations necessary for the establishment of a preventive restructuring framework. Member States should not be obliged to derogate from company law, wholly or partially, for an indefinite or for a limited period of time, if they ensure that their company law requirements do not jeopardise the effectiveness of the restructuring process or if Member States have other, equally effective tools in place to ensure that shareholders do not unreasonably prevent the adoption or implementation of a restructuring plan which would restore the viability of the business. In this context, Member States should attach particular importance to the effectiveness of provisions relating to a stay of individual enforcement actions and confirmation of the restructuring plan which should not be unduly impaired by calls for, or the results of, general meetings of shareholders. Directive (EU) 2017/1132 should therefore be amended accordingly. Member States should enjoy a margin of appreciation in assessing which derogations are needed in the context of national company law in order to effectively implement this Directive, and should also be able to provide for similar exemptions from Directive (EU) 2017/1132 in the case of insolvency proceedings not covered by this Directive but which allow for restructuring measures to be taken. (97) In respect of the establishment of, and subsequent changes to, the data communication form, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. (98) A study should be carried out by the Commission in order to evaluate the necessity of submitting legislative proposals to deal with the insolvency of persons not exercising a trade, business, craft or profession, who, as consumers, in good faith, are temporarily or permanently unable to pay debts as they fall due. Such study should investigate whether access to basic goods and services needs to be safeguarded for those persons to ensure that they benefit from decent living conditions. (99) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (22), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. (100) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because differences between national restructuring and insolvency frameworks would continue to raise obstacles to the free movement of capital and the freedom of establishment, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (101) On 7 June 2017, the European Central Bank delivered an opinion (23), HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: TITLE I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter and scope 1. This Directive lays down rules on: (a) preventive restructuring frameworks available for debtors in financial difficulties when there is a likelihood of insolvency, with a view to preventing the insolvency and ensuring the viability of the debtor; (b) procedures leading to a discharge of debt incurred by insolvent entrepreneurs; and (c) measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt. 2. This Directive does not apply to procedures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article that concern debtors that are: (a) insurance undertakings or reinsurance undertakings as defined in points (1) and (4) of Article 13 of Directive 2009/138/EC; (b) credit institutions as defined in point (1) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; (c) investment firms or collective investment undertakings as defined in points (2) and (7) of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; (d) central counter parties as defined in point (1) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012; (e) central securities depositories as defined in point (1) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014; (f) other financial institutions and entities listed in the first subparagraph of Article 1(1) of Directive 2014/59/EU; (g) public bodies under national law; and (h) natural persons who are not entrepreneurs. 3. Member States may exclude from the scope of this Directive procedures referred to in paragraph 1 that concern debtors which are financial entities, other than those referred to in paragraph 2, providing financial services which are subject to special arrangements under which the national supervisory or resolution authorities have wide-ranging powers of intervention comparable to those laid down in Union and national law in relation to the financial entities referred to in paragraph 2. Member States shall communicate those special arrangements to the Commission. 4. Member States may extend the application of the procedures referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 to insolvent natural persons who are not entrepreneurs. Member States may restrict the application of point (a) of paragraph 1 to legal persons. 5. Member States may provide that the following claims are excluded from, or are not affected by, preventive restructuring frameworks referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1: (a) existing and future claims of existing or former workers; (b) maintenance claims arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity; or (c) claims that arise from tortious liability of the debtor. 6. Member States shall ensure that preventive restructuring frameworks have no impact on accrued occupational pension entitlements. Article 2 Definitions 1. For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (1) restructuring means measures aimed at restructuring the debtor's business that include changing the composition, conditions or structure of a debtor's assets and liabilities or any other part of the debtor's capital structure, such as sales of assets or parts of the business and, where so provided under national law, the sale of the business as a going concern, as well as any necessary operational changes, or a combination of those elements; (2) affected parties means creditors, including, where applicable under national law, workers, or classes of creditors and, where applicable, under national law, equity holders, whose claims or interests, respectively, are directly affected by a restructuring plan; (3) equity holder means a person that has an ownership interest in a debtor or a debtor's business, including a shareholder, in so far as that person is not a creditor; (4) stay of individual enforcement actions means a temporary suspension, granted by a judicial or administrative authority or applied by operation of law, of the right of a creditor to enforce a claim against a debtor and, where so provided for by national law, against a third-party security provider, in the context of a judicial, administrative or other procedure, or of the right to seize or realise out of court the assets or business of the debtor; (5) executory contract means a contract between a debtor and one or more creditors under which the parties still have obligations to perform at the time the stay of individual enforcement actions is granted or applied; (6) best-interest-of-creditors test means a test that is satisfied if no dissenting creditor would be worse off under a restructuring plan than such a creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities under national law were applied, either in the event of liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative scenario if the restructuring plan were not confirmed; (7) new financing means any new financial assistance provided by an existing or a new creditor in order to implement a restructuring plan and that is included in that restructuring plan; (8) interim financing means any new financial assistance, provided by an existing or a new creditor, that includes, as a minimum, financial assistance during the stay of individual enforcement actions, and that is reasonable and immediately necessary for the debtor's business to continue operating, or to preserve or enhance the value of that business; (9) entrepreneur means a natural person exercising a trade, business, craft or profession; (10) full discharge of debt means that enforcement against entrepreneurs of their outstanding dischargeable debts is precluded or that outstanding dischargeable debts as such are cancelled, as part of a procedure which could include a realisation of assets or a repayment plan or both; (11) repayment plan means a programme of payments of specified amounts on specified dates by an insolvent entrepreneur to creditors, or a periodic transfer to creditors of a certain part of entrepreneur's disposable income during the discharge period; (12) practitioner in the field of restructuring means any person or body appointed by a judicial or administrative authority to carry out, in particular, one or more of the following tasks: (a) assisting the debtor or the creditors in drafting or negotiating a restructuring plan; (b) supervising the activity of the debtor during the negotiations on a restructuring plan, and reporting to a judicial or administrative authority; (c) taking partial control over the assets or affairs of the debtor during negotiations. 2. For the purposes of this Directive, the following concepts are to be understood as defined by national law: (a) insolvency; (b) likelihood of insolvency; (c) micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Article 3 Early warning and access to information 1. Member States shall ensure that debtors have access to one or more clear and transparent early warning tools which can detect circumstances that could give rise to a likelihood of insolvency and can signal to them the need to act without delay. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, Member States may make use of up-to-date IT technologies for notifications and for communication. 2. Early warning tools may include the following: (a) alert mechanisms when the debtor has not made certain types of payments; (b) advisory services provided by public or private organisations. (c) incentives under national law for third parties with relevant information about the debtor, such as accountants, tax and social security authorities, to flag to the debtor a negative development. 3. Member States shall ensure that debtors and employees' representatives have access to relevant and up-to-date information about the availability of early warning tools as well as of the procedures and measures concerning restructuring and discharge of debt. 4. Member States shall ensure that information on access to early warning tools is publicly available online and that, in particular for SMEs, it is easily accessible and presented in a user-friendly manner. 5. Member States may provide support to employees' representatives for the assessment of the economic situation of the debtor. TITLE II PREVENTIVE RESTRUCTURING FRAMEWORKS CHAPTER 1 Availability of preventive restructuring frameworks Article 4 Availability of preventive restructuring frameworks 1. Member States shall ensure that, where there is a likelihood of insolvency, debtors have access to a preventive restructuring framework that enables them to restructure, with a view to preventing insolvency and ensuring their viability, without prejudice to other solutions for avoiding insolvency, thereby protecting jobs and maintaining business activity. 2. Member States may provide that debtors that have been sentenced for serious breaches of accounting or bookkeeping obligations under national law are allowed to access a preventive restructuring framework only after those debtors have taken adequate measures to remedy the issues that gave rise to the sentence, with a view to providing creditors with the necessary information to enable them to take a decision during restructuring negotiations. 3. Member States may maintain or introduce a viability test under national law, provided that such a test has the purpose of excluding debtors that do not have a prospect of viability, and that it can be carried out without detriment to the debtors' assets. 4. Member States may limit the number of times within a certain period a debtor can access a preventive restructuring framework as provided for under this Directive. 5. The preventive restructuring framework provided for under this Directive may consist of one or more procedures, measures or provisions, some of which may take place out of court, without prejudice to any other restructuring frameworks under national law. Member States shall ensure that such restructuring framework affords debtors and affected parties the rights and safeguards provided for in this Title in a coherent manner. 6. Member States may put in place provisions limiting the involvement of a judicial or administrative authority in a preventive restructuring framework to where it is necessary and proportionate while ensuring that rights of any affected parties and relevant stakeholders are safeguarded. 7. Preventive restructuring frameworks provided for under this Directive shall be available on application by debtors. 8. Member States may also provide that preventive restructuring frameworks provided for under this Directive are available at the request of creditors and employees' representatives, subject to the agreement of the debtor. Member States may limit that requirement to obtain the debtor's agreement to cases where debtors are SMEs. CHAPTER 2 Facilitating negotiations on preventive restructuring plans Article 5 Debtor in possession 1. Member States shall ensure that debtors accessing preventive restructuring procedures remain totally, or at least partially, in control of their assets and the day-to-day operation of their business. 2. Where necessary, the appointment by a judicial or administrative authority of a practitioner in the field of restructuring shall be decided on a case-by-case basis, except in certain circumstances where Member States may require the mandatory appointment of such a practitioner in every case. 3. Member States shall provide for the appointment of a practitioner in the field of restructuring, to assist the debtor and creditors in negotiating and drafting the plan, at least in the following cases: (a) where a general stay of individual enforcement actions, in accordance with Article 6(3), is granted by a judicial or administrative authority, and the judicial or administrative authority decides that such a practitioner is necessary to safeguard the interest of the parties; (b) where the restructuring plan needs to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority by means of a cross-class cram-down, in accordance with Article 11; or (c) where it is requested by the debtor or by a majority of the creditors, provided that, in the latter case, the cost of the practitioner is borne by the creditors. Article 6 Stay of individual enforcement actions 1. Member States shall ensure that debtors can benefit from a stay of individual enforcement actions to support the negotiations of a restructuring plan in a preventive restructuring framework. Member States may provide that judicial or administrative authorities can refuse to grant a stay of individual enforcement actions where such a stay is not necessary or where it would not achieve the objective set out in the first subparagraph. 2. Without prejudice to paragraphs 4 and 5, Member States shall ensure that a stay of individual enforcement actions can cover all types of claims, including secured claims and preferential claims. 3. Member States may provide that a stay of individual enforcement actions can be general, covering all creditors, or can be limited, covering one or more individual creditors or categories of creditors. Where a stay is limited, the stay shall only apply to creditors that have been informed, in accordance with national law, of negotiations as referred to in paragraph 1 on the restructuring plan or of the stay. 4. Member States may exclude certain claims or categories of claims from the scope of the stay of individual enforcement actions, in well-defined circumstances, where such an exclusion is duly justified and where: (a) enforcement is not likely to jeopardise the restructuring of the business; or (b) the stay would unfairly prejudice the creditors of those claims. 5. Paragraph 2 shall not apply to workers' claims. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, Member States may apply paragraph 2 to workers' claims if, and to the extent that, Member States ensure that the payment of such claims is guaranteed in preventive restructuring frameworks at a similar level of protection. 6. The initial duration of a stay of individual enforcement actions shall be limited to a maximum period of no more than four months. 7. Notwithstanding paragraph 6, Member States may enable judicial or administrative authorities to extend the duration of a stay of individual enforcement actions or to grant a new stay of individual enforcement actions, at the request of the debtor, a creditor or, where applicable, a practitioner in the field of restructuring. Such extension or new stay of individual enforcement actions shall be granted only if well-defined circumstances show that such extension or new stay is duly justified, such as: (a) relevant progress has been made in the negotiations on the restructuring plan; (b) the continuation of the stay of individual enforcement actions does not unfairly prejudice the rights or interests of any affected parties; or (c) insolvency proceedings which could end in the liquidation of the debtor under national law have not yet been opened in respect of the debtor. 8. The total duration of the stay of individual enforcement actions, including extensions and renewals, shall not exceed 12 months. Where Member States choose to implement this Directive by means of one or more procedures or measures which do not fulfil the conditions for notification under Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848, the total duration of the stay under such procedures shall be limited to no more than four months if the centre of main interests of the debtor has been transferred from another Member State within a three-month period prior to the filing of a request for the opening of preventive restructuring proceedings. 9. Member States shall ensure that judicial or administrative authorities can lift a stay of individual enforcement actions in the following cases: (a) the stay no longer fulfils the objective of supporting the negotiations on the restructuring plan, for example if it becomes apparent that a proportion of creditors which, under national law, could prevent the adoption of the restructuring plan do not support the continuation of the negotiations; (b) at the request of the debtor or the practitioner in the field of restructuring; (c) where so provided for in national law, if one or more creditors or one or more classes of creditors are, or would be, unfairly prejudiced by a stay of individual enforcement actions; or (d) where so provided for in national law, if the stay gives rise to the insolvency of a creditor. Member States may limit the power, under the first subparagraph, to lift the stay of individual enforcement actions to situations where creditors had not had the opportunity to be heard before the stay came into force or before an extension of the period was granted by a judicial or administrative authority. Member States may provide for a minimum period, which does not exceed the period referred to in paragraph 6, during which a stay of individual enforcement actions cannot be lifted. Article 7 Consequences of the stay of individual enforcement actions 1. Where an obligation on a debtor, provided for under national law, to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings which could end in the liquidation of the debtor, arises during a stay of individual enforcement actions, that obligation shall be suspended for the duration of that stay. 2. A stay of individual enforcement actions in accordance with Article 6 shall suspend, for the duration of the stay, the opening, at the request of one or more creditors, of insolvency proceedings which could end in the liquidation of the debtor. 3. Member States may derogate from paragraphs 1 and 2 in situations where a debtor is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. In such cases, Member States shall ensure that a judicial or administrative authority can decide to keep in place the benefit of the stay of individual enforcement actions, if, taking into account the circumstances of the case, the opening of insolvency proceedings which could end in the liquidation of the debtor would not be in the general interest of creditors. 4. Member States shall provide for rules preventing creditors to which the stay applies from withholding performance or terminating, accelerating or, in any other way, modifying essential executory contracts to the detriment of the debtor, for debts that came into existence prior to the stay, solely by virtue of the fact that they were not paid by the debtor. Essential executory contracts shall be understood to mean executory contracts which are necessary for the continuation of the day-to-day operations of the business, including contracts concerning supplies, the suspension of which would lead to the debtor's activities coming to a standstill. The first subparagraph shall not preclude Member States from affording such creditors appropriate safeguards with a view to preventing unfair prejudice being caused to such creditors as a result of that subparagraph. Member States may provide that this paragraph also applies to non-essential executory contracts. 5. Member States shall ensure that creditors are not allowed to withhold performance or terminate, accelerate or, in any other way, modify executory contracts to the detriment of the debtor by virtue of a contractual clause providing for such measures, solely by reason of: (a) a request for the opening of preventive restructuring proceedings; (b) a request for a stay of individual enforcement actions; (c) the opening of preventive restructuring proceedings; or (d) the granting of a stay of individual enforcement actions as such. 6. Member States may provide that a stay of individual enforcement actions does not apply to netting arrangements, including close-out netting arrangements, on financial markets, energy markets and commodity markets, even in circumstances where Article 31(1) does not apply, if such arrangements are enforceable under national insolvency law. The stay shall, however, apply to the enforcement by a creditor of a claim against a debtor arising as a result of the operation of a netting arrangement. The first subparagraph shall not apply to contracts for the supply of goods, services or energy necessary for the operation of the debtor's business, unless such contracts take the form of a position traded on an exchange or other market, such that it can be substituted at any time at current market value. 7. Member States shall ensure that the expiry of a stay of individual enforcement actions without the adoption of a restructuring plan does not, of itself, give rise to the opening of an insolvency procedure which could end in the liquidation of the debtor, unless the other conditions for such opening laid down by national law are fulfilled. CHAPTER 3 Restructuring plans Article 8 Content of restructuring plans 1. Member States shall require that restructuring plans submitted for adoption in accordance with Article 9, or for confirmation by a judicial or administrative authority in accordance with Article 10, contain at least the following information: (a) the identity of the debtor; (b) the debtor's assets and liabilities at the time of submission of the restructuring plan, including a value for the assets, a description of the economic situation of the debtor and the position of workers, and a description of the causes and the extent of the difficulties of the debtor; (c) the affected parties, whether named individually or described by categories of debt in accordance with national law, as well as their claims or interests covered by the restructuring plan; (d) where applicable, the classes into which the affected parties have been grouped, for the purpose of adopting the restructuring plan, and the respective values of claims and interests in each class; (e) where applicable, the parties, whether named individually or described by categories of debt in accordance with national law, which are not affected by the restructuring plan, together with a description of the reasons why it is proposed not to affect them; (f) where applicable, the identity of the practitioner in the field of restructuring; (g) the terms of the restructuring plan, including, in particular: (i) any proposed restructuring measures as referred to in point (1) of Article 2(1); (ii) where applicable, the proposed duration of any proposed restructuring measures; (iii) the arrangements with regard to informing and consulting the employees' representatives in accordance with Union and national law; (iv) where applicable, overall consequences as regards employment such as dismissals, short-time working arrangements or similar; (v) the estimated financial flows of the debtor, if provided for by national law; and (vi) any new financing anticipated as part of the restructuring plan, and the reasons why the new financing is necessary to implement that plan; (h) a statement of reasons which explains why the restructuring plan has a reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency of the debtor and ensuring the viability of the business, including the necessary pre-conditions for the success of the plan. Member States may require that that statement of reasons be made or validated either by an external expert or by the practitioner in the field of restructuring if such a practitioner is appointed. 2. Member States shall make available online a comprehensive check-list for restructuring plans, adapted to the needs of SMEs. The check-list shall include practical guidelines on how the restructuring plan has to be drafted under national law. The check-list shall be made available in the official language or languages of the Member State. Member States shall consider making the check-list available in at least one other language, in particular in a language used in international business. Article 9 Adoption of restructuring plans 1. Member States shall ensure that, irrespective of who applies for a preventive restructuring procedure in accordance with Article 4, debtors have the right to submit restructuring plans for adoption by the affected parties. Member States may also provide that creditors and practitioners in the field of restructuring have the right to submit restructuring plans, and provide for conditions under which they may do so. 2. Member States shall ensure that affected parties have a right to vote on the adoption of a restructuring plan. Parties that are not affected by a restructuring plan shall not have voting rights in the adoption of that plan. 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, Member States may exclude from the right to vote the following: (a) equity holders; (b) creditors whose claims rank below the claims of ordinary unsecured creditors in the normal ranking of liquidation priorities; or (c) any related party of the debtor or the debtor's business, with a conflict of interest under national law. 4. Member States shall ensure that affected parties are treated in separate classes which reflect sufficient commonality of interest based on verifiable criteria, in accordance with national law. As a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes for the purposes of adopting a restructuring plan. Member States may also provide that workers' claims are treated in a separate class of their own. Member States may provide that debtors that are SMEs can opt not to treat affected parties in separate classes. Member States shall put in place appropriate measures to ensure that class formation is done with a particular view to protecting vulnerable creditors such as small suppliers. 5. Voting rights and the formation of classes shall be examined by a judicial or administrative authority when a request for confirmation of the restructuring plan is submitted. Member States may require a judicial or administrative authority to examine and confirm the voting rights and formation of classes at an earlier stage than that referred to in the first subparagraph. 6. A restructuring plan shall be adopted by affected parties, provided that a majority in the amount of their claims or interests is obtained in each class. Member States may, in addition, require that a majority in the number of affected parties is obtained in each class. Member States shall lay down the majorities required for the adoption of a restructuring plan. Those majorities shall not be higher than 75 % of the amount of claims or interests in each class or, where applicable, of the number of affected parties in each class. 7. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 to 6, Member States may provide that a formal vote on the adoption of a restructuring plan can be replaced by an agreement with the requisite majority. Article 10 Confirmation of restructuring plans 1. Member States shall ensure that at least the following restructuring plans are binding on the parties only if they are confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority: (a) restructuring plans which affect the claims or interests of dissenting affected parties; (b) restructuring plans which provide for new financing; (c) restructuring plans which involve the loss of more than 25 % of the workforce, if such loss is permitted under national law. 2. Member States shall ensure that the conditions under which a restructuring plan can be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority are clearly specified and include at least the following: (a) the restructuring plan has been adopted in accordance with Article 9; (b) creditors with sufficient commonality of interest in the same class are treated equally, and in a manner proportionate to their claim; (c) notification of the restructuring plan has been given in accordance with national law to all affected parties; (d) where there are dissenting creditors, the restructuring plan satisfies the best-interest-of-creditors test; (e) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the restructuring plan and does not unfairly prejudice the interests of creditors. Compliance with point (d) of the first subparagraph shall be examined by a judicial or administrative authority only if the restructuring plan is challenged on that ground. 3. Member States shall ensure that judicial or administrative authorities are able to refuse to confirm a restructuring plan where that plan would not have a reasonable prospect of preventing the insolvency of the debtor or ensuring the viability of the business. 4. Member States shall ensure that where a judicial or administrative authority is required to confirm a restructuring plan in order for it to become binding, the decision is taken in an efficient manner with a view to expeditious treatment of the matter. Article 11 Cross-class cram-down 1. Member States shall ensure that a restructuring plan which is not approved by affected parties, as provided for in Article 9(6), in every voting class, may be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority upon the proposal of a debtor or with the debtor's agreement, and become binding upon dissenting voting classes where the restructuring plan fulfils at least the following conditions: (a) it complies with Article 10(2) and (3); (b) it has been approved by: (i) a majority of the voting classes of affected parties, provided that at least one of those classes is a secured creditors class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors class; or, failing that, (ii) at least one of the voting classes of affected parties or where so provided under national law, impaired parties, other than an equity-holders class or any other class which, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going concern, would not receive any payment or keep any interest, or, where so provided under national law, which could be reasonably presumed not to receive any payment or keep any interest, if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied under national law; (c) it ensures that dissenting voting classes of affected creditors are treated at least as favourably as any other class of the same rank and more favourably than any junior class; and (d) no class of affected parties can, under the restructuring plan, receive or keep more than the full amount of its claims or interests. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, Member States may limit the requirement to obtain the debtor's agreement to cases where debtors are SMEs. Member States may increase the minimum number of classes of affected parties or, where so provided under national law, impaired parties, required to approve the plan as laid down in point (b)(ii) of the first subparagraph. 2. By way of derogation from point (c) of paragraph 1, Member States may provide that the claims of affected creditors in a dissenting voting class are satisfied in full by the same or equivalent means where a more junior class is to receive any payment or keep any interest under the restructuring plan. Member States may maintain or introduce provisions derogating from the first subparagraph where they are necessary in order to achieve the aims of the restructuring plan and where the restructuring plan does not unfairly prejudice the rights or interests of any affected parties. Article 12 Equity holders 1. Where Member States exclude equity holders from the application of Articles 9 to 11, they shall ensure by other means that those equity holders are not allowed to unreasonably prevent or create obstacles to the adoption and confirmation of a restructuring plan. 2. Member States shall also ensure that equity holders are not allowed to unreasonably prevent or create obstacles to the implementation of a restructuring plan. 3. Member States may adapt what it means to unreasonably prevent or create obstacles under this Article to take into account, inter alia: whether the debtor is an SME or a large enterprise; the proposed restructuring measures touching upon the rights of equity holders; the type of equity holder; whether the debtor is a legal or a natural person; or whether partners in a company have limited or unlimited liability. Article 13 Workers 1. Members States shall ensure that individual and collective workers' rights, under Union and national labour law, such as the following, are not affected by the preventive restructuring framework: (a) the right to collective bargaining and industrial action; and (b) the right to information and consultation in accordance with Directive 2002/14/EC and Directive 2009/38/EC, in particular: (i) information to employees' representatives about the recent and probable development of the undertaking's or the establishment's activities and economic situation, enabling them to communicate to the debtor concerns about the situation of the business and as regards the need to consider restructuring mechanisms; (ii) information to employees' representatives about any preventive restructuring procedure which could have an impact on employment, such as on the ability of workers to recover their wages and any future payments, including occupational pensions; (iii) information to and consultation of employees' representatives about restructuring plans before they are submitted for adoption in accordance with Article 9, or for confirmation by a judicial or administrative authority in accordance with Article 10; (c) the rights guaranteed by Directives 98/59/EC, 2001/23/EC and 2008/94/EC. 2. Where the restructuring plan includes measures leading to changes in the work organisation or in contractual relations with workers, those measures shall be approved by those workers, if national law or collective agreements provide for such approval in such cases. Article 14 Valuation by the judicial or administrative authority 1. The judicial or administrative authority shall take a decision on the valuation of the debtor's business only where a restructuring plan is challenged by a dissenting affected party on the grounds of either: (a) an alleged failure to satisfy the best-interest-of-creditors test under point (6) of Article 2(1); or (b) an alleged breach of the conditions for a cross-class cram-down under point (ii) of Article 11(1)(b). 2. Member States shall ensure that, for the purpose of taking a decision on a valuation in accordance with paragraph 1, judicial or administrative authorities may appoint or hear properly qualified experts. 3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, Member States shall ensure that a dissenting affected party may lodge a challenge with the judicial or administrative authority called upon to confirm the restructuring plan. Member States may provide that such a challenge can be lodged in the context of an appeal against a decision on the confirmation of a restructuring plan. Article 15 Effects of restructuring plans 1. Member States shall ensure that restructuring plans that are confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority are binding upon all affected parties named or described in accordance with point (c) of Article 8(1). 2. Member States shall ensure that creditors that are not involved in the adoption of a restructuring plan under national law are not affected by the plan. Article 16 Appeals 1. Member States shall ensure that any appeal provided for under national law against a decision to confirm or reject a restructuring plan taken by a judicial authority is brought before a higher judicial authority. Member States shall ensure that an appeal against a decision to confirm or reject a restructuring plan taken by an administrative authority is brought before a judicial authority. 2. Appeals shall be resolved in an efficient manner with a view to expeditious treatment. 3. An appeal against a decision confirming a restructuring plan shall have no suspensive effects on the execution of that plan. By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, Member States may provide that judicial authorities can suspend the execution of the restructuring plan or parts thereof where necessary and appropriate to safeguard the interests of a party. 4. Member States shall ensure that, where an appeal pursuant to paragraph 3 is upheld, the judicial authority may either: (a) set aside the restructuring plan; or (b) confirm the restructuring plan, either with amendments, where so provided under national law, or without amendments. Member States may provide that, where a plan is confirmed under point (b) of the first subparagraph, compensation is granted to any party that incurred monetary losses and whose appeal is upheld. CHAPTER 4 Protection for new financing, interim financing and other restructuring related transactions Article 17 Protection for new financing and interim financing 1. Member States shall ensure that new financing and interim financing are adequately protected. As a minimum, in the case of any subsequent insolvency of the debtor: (a) new financing and interim financing shall not be declared void, voidable or unenforceable; and (b) the grantors of such financing shall not incur civil, administrative or criminal liability, on the ground that such financing is detrimental to the general body of creditors, unless other additional grounds laid down by national law are present. 2. Member States may provide that paragraph 1 shall only apply to new financing if the restructuring plan has been confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority, and to interim financing which has been subject to ex ante control. 3. Member States may exclude from the application of paragraph 1 interim financing which is granted after the debtor has become unable to pay its debts as they fall due. 4. Member States may provide that grantors of new or interim financing are entitled to receive payment with priority in the context of subsequent insolvency procedures in relation to other creditors that would otherwise have superior or equal claims. Article 18 Protection for other restructuring related transactions 1. Without prejudice to Article 17, Member States shall ensure that, in the event of any subsequent insolvency of a debtor, transactions that are reasonable and immediately necessary for the negotiation of a restructuring plan are not declared void, voidable or unenforceable on the ground that such transactions are detrimental to the general body of creditors, unless other additional grounds laid down by national law are present. 2. Member States may provide that paragraph 1 only applies where the plan is confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority or where such transactions were subject to ex ante control. 3. Member States may exclude from the application of paragraph 1 transactions that are carried out after the debtor has become unable to pay its debts as they fall due. 4. Transactions referred to in paragraph 1 shall include, as a minimum: (a) the payment of fees for and costs of negotiating, adopting or confirming a restructuring plan; (b) the payment of fees for and costs of seeking professional advice closely connected with the restructuring; (c) the payment of workers' wages for work already carried out without prejudice to other protection provided in Union or national law; (d) any payments and disbursements made in the ordinary course of business other than those referred to in points (a) to (c). 5. Without prejudice to Article 17, Member States shall ensure that, in the event of any subsequent insolvency of the debtor, transactions that are reasonable and immediately necessary for the implementation of a restructuring plan, and that are carried out in accordance with the restructuring plan confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority, are not declared void, voidable or unenforceable on the ground that such transactions are detrimental to the general body of creditors, unless other additional grounds laid down by national law are present. CHAPTER 5 Duties of directors Article 19 Duties of directors where there is a likelihood of insolvency Member States shall ensure that, where there is a likelihood of insolvency, directors, have due regard, as a minimum, to the following: (a) the interests of creditors, equity holders and other stakeholders; (b) the need to take steps to avoid insolvency; and (c) the need to avoid deliberate or grossly negligent conduct that threatens the viability of the business. TITLE III DISCHARGE OF DEBT AND DISQUALIFICATIONS Article 20 Access to discharge 1. Member States shall ensure that insolvent entrepreneurs have access to at least one procedure that can lead to a full discharge of debt in accordance with this Directive. Member States may require that the trade, business, craft or profession to which an insolvent entrepreneur's debts are related has ceased. 2. Member States in which a full discharge of debt is conditional on a partial repayment of debt by the entrepreneur shall ensure that the related repayment obligation is based on the individual situation of the entrepreneur and, in particular, is proportionate to the entrepreneur's seizable or disposable income and assets during the discharge period, and takes into account the equitable interest of creditors. 3. Member States shall ensure that entrepreneurs who have been discharged from their debts may benefit from existing national frameworks providing for business support for entrepreneurs, including access to relevant and up-to-date information about these frameworks. Article 21 Discharge period 1. Member States shall ensure that the period after which insolvent entrepreneurs are able to be fully discharged from their debts is no longer than three years starting at the latest from the date of either: (a) in the case of a procedure which includes a repayment plan, the decision by a judicial or administrative authority to confirm the plan or the start of the implementation of the plan; or (b) in the case of any other procedure, the decision by the judicial or administrative authority to open the procedure, or the establishment of the entrepreneur's insolvency estate. 2. Member States shall ensure that insolvent entrepreneurs who have complied with their obligations, where such obligations exist under national law, are discharged of their debt on expiry of the discharge period without the need to apply to a judicial or administrative authority to open a procedure additional to those referred to in paragraph 1. Without prejudice to the first subparagraph, Member States may maintain or introduce provisions allowing the judicial or administrative authority to verify whether the entrepreneurs have fulfilled the obligations for obtaining a discharge of debt. 3. Member States may provide that a full discharge of debt does not hinder the continuation of an insolvency procedure that entails the realisation and distribution of assets of an entrepreneur that formed part of the insolvency estate of that entrepreneur as at the date of expiry of the discharge period. Article 22 Disqualification period 1. Member States shall ensure that, where an insolvent entrepreneur obtains a discharge of debt in accordance with this Directive, any disqualifications from taking up or pursuing a trade, business, craft or profession on the sole ground that the entrepreneur is insolvent, shall cease to have effect, at the latest, at the end of the discharge period. 2. Member States shall ensure that, on expiry of the discharge period, the disqualifications referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article cease to have effect without the need to apply to a judicial or administrative authority to open a procedure additional to those referred to in Article 21(1). Article 23 Derogations 1. By way of derogation from Articles 20 to 22, Member States shall maintain or introduce provisions denying or restricting access to discharge of debt, revoking the benefit of such discharge or providing for longer periods for obtaining a full discharge of debt or longer disqualification periods, where the insolvent entrepreneur acted dishonestly or in bad faith under national law towards creditors or other stakeholders when becoming indebted, during the insolvency proceedings or during the payment of the debt, without prejudice to national rules on burden of proof. 2. By way of derogation from Articles 20 to 22, Member States may maintain or introduce provisions denying or restricting access to discharge of debt, revoking the benefit of discharge or providing for longer periods for obtaining a full discharge of debt or longer disqualification periods in certain well-defined circumstances and where such derogations are duly justified, such as where: (a) the insolvent entrepreneur has substantially violated obligations under a repayment plan or any other legal obligation aimed at safeguarding the interests of creditors, including the obligation to maximise returns to creditors; (b) the insolvent entrepreneur has failed to comply with information or cooperation obligations under Union and national law; (c) there are abusive applications for a discharge of debt; (d) there is a further application for a discharge within a certain period after the insolvent entrepreneur was granted a full discharge of debt or was denied a full discharge of debt due to a serious violation of information or cooperation obligations; (e) the cost of the procedure leading to the discharge of debt is not covered; or (f) a derogation is necessary to guarantee the balance between the rights of the debtor and the rights of one or more creditors. 3. By way of derogation from Article 21, Member States may provide for longer discharge periods in cases where: (a) protective measures are approved or ordered by a judicial or administrative authority in order to safeguard the main residence of the insolvent entrepreneur and, where applicable, of the entrepreneur's family, or the essential assets for the continuation of the entrepreneur's trade, business, craft or profession; or (b) the main residence of the insolvent entrepreneur and, where applicable, of the entrepreneur's family, is not realised. 4. Member States may exclude specific categories of debt from discharge of debt, or restrict access to discharge of debt or lay down a longer discharge period where such exclusions, restrictions or longer periods are duly justified, such as in the case of: (a) secured debts; (b) debts arising from or in connection with criminal penalties; (c) debts arising from tortious liability; (d) debts regarding maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity; (e) debts incurred after the application for or opening of the procedure leading to a discharge of debt; and (f) debts arising from the obligation to pay the cost of the procedure leading to a discharge of debt. 5. By way of derogation from Article 22, Member States may provide for longer or indefinite disqualification periods where the insolvent entrepreneur is a member of a profession: (a) to which specific ethical rules or specific rules on reputation or expertise apply, and the entrepreneur has infringed those rules; or (b) dealing with the management of the property of others. The first subparagraph shall also apply where an insolvent entrepreneur requests access to a profession as referred to in point (a) or (b) of that subparagraph. 6. This Directive is without prejudice to national rules regarding disqualifications ordered by a judicial or administrative authority other than those referred to in Article 22. Article 24 Consolidation of proceedings regarding professional and personal debts 1. Member States shall ensure that, where insolvent entrepreneurs have professional debts incurred in the course of their trade, business, craft or profession as well as personal debts incurred outside those activities, which cannot be reasonably separated, such debts, if dischargeable, shall be treated in a single procedure for the purposes of obtaining a full discharge of debt. 2. Member States may provide that, where professional debts and personal debts can be separated, those debts are to be treated, for the purposes of obtaining a full discharge of debt, either in separate but coordinated procedures or in the same procedure. TITLE IV MEASURES TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF PROCEDURES CONCERNING RESTRUCTURING, INSOLVENCY AND DISCHARGE OF DEBT Article 25 Judicial and administrative authorities Without prejudice to judicial independence and to any differences in the organisation of the judiciary across the Union, Member States shall ensure that: (a) members of the judicial and administrative authorities dealing with procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt receive suitable training and have the necessary expertise for their responsibilities; and (b) procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt are dealt with in an efficient manner, with a view to the expeditious treatment of procedures. Article 26 Practitioners in procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt 1. Member States shall ensure that: (a) practitioners appointed by a judicial or administrative authority in procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt (practitioners) receive suitable training and have the necessary expertise for their responsibilities; (b) the conditions for eligibility, as well as the process for the appointment, removal and resignation of practitioners are clear, transparent and fair; (c) in appointing a practitioner for a particular case, including cases with cross-border elements, due consideration is given to the practitioner's experience and expertise, and to the specific features of the case; and (d) in order to avoid any conflict of interest, debtors and creditors have the opportunity to either object to the selection or appointment of a practitioner or request the replacement of the practitioner. 2. The Commission shall facilitate the sharing of best practices between Member States with a view to improving the quality of training across the Union, including by means of the exchange of experiences and capacity building tools. Article 27 Supervision and remuneration of practitioners 1. Member States shall put in place appropriate oversight and regulatory mechanisms to ensure that the work of practitioners is effectively supervised, with a view to ensuring that their services are provided in an effective and competent way, and, in relation to the parties involved, are provided impartially and independently.

Since further amendments are to be made, that Directive should be recast in the interests of clarity. (2) Pursuant to Article 13 of Directive 2003/98/EC and five years after the adoption of Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), which amended Directive 2003/98/EC, the Commission, after consulting the relevant stakeholders, evaluated and reviewed the functioning of Directive 2003/98/EC in the framework of a regulatory fitness and performance programme. (3) Following the stakeholder consultation and in the light of the result of the impact assessment, the Commission considered that action at Union level was necessary in order to address the remaining and emerging barriers to a wide re-use of public sector and publicly funded information across the Union, in order to bring the legislative framework up to date with the advances in digital technologies and to further stimulate digital innovation, especially with regard to artificial intelligence. (4) The substantive changes introduced to the legal text so as to fully exploit the potential of public sector information for the European economy and society should focus on the following areas: the provision of real-time access to dynamic data via adequate technical means, the increase of the supply of valuable public data for re-use, including from public undertakings, research performing organisations and research funding organisations, the tackling of the emergence of new forms of exclusive arrangements, the use of exceptions to the principle of charging the marginal cost and the relationship between this Directive and certain related legal instruments, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Directives 96/9/EC (6), 2003/4/EC (7) and 2007/2/EC (8) of the European Parliament and of the Council. (5) Access to information is a fundamental right. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter) provides that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. (6) Article 8 of the Charter guarantees the right to the protection of personal data and provides that such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law, and subject to control by an independent authority. (7) The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for the establishment of an internal market and of a system ensuring that competition in the internal market is not distorted. Harmonisation of the rules and practices in the Member States relating to the exploitation of public sector information contributes to the achievement of those objectives. (8) The public sector in Member States collects, produces, reproduces and disseminates a wide range of information in many areas of activity, such as social, political, economic, legal, geographical, environmental, meteorological, seismic, touristic, business, patent-related and educational areas. Documents produced by public sector bodies of the executive, legislature or judiciary constitute a vast, diverse and valuable pool of resources that can benefit society. Providing that information, which includes dynamic data, in a commonly used electronic format allows citizens and legal entities to find new ways to use them and create new, innovative products and services. Member States and public sector bodies may be able to benefit from and receive adequate financial support from relevant Union funds and programmes, ensuring a wide use of digital technologies or the digital transformation of public administrations and public services, in their efforts to make data easily available for re-use. (9) Public sector information represents an extraordinary source of data that can contribute to improving the internal market and to the development of new applications for consumers and legal entities. Intelligent data usage, including their processing through artificial intelligence applications, can have a transformative effect on all sectors of the economy. (10) Directive 2003/98/EC established a set of minimum rules governing the re-use and the practical arrangements for facilitating re-use of existing documents held by public sector bodies of the Member States, including executive, legislative and judicial bodies. Since the adoption of the first set of rules on re-use of public sector information, the amount of data in the world, including public data, has increased exponentially and new types of data are being generated and collected. In parallel, there is a continuous evolution in technologies for analysis, exploitation and processing of data, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and the internet of things. That rapid technological evolution makes it possible to create new services and new applications, which are built upon the use, aggregation or combination of data. The rules originally adopted in 2003, and amended in 2013, no longer keep pace with those rapid changes, and as a result, the economic and social opportunities offered by the re-use of public data risk being missed. (11) The evolution towards a data-based society, where data from different domains and activities are used, influences the life of every citizen in the Union, inter alia, by enabling them to gain new ways of accessing and acquiring knowledge. (12) Digital content plays an important role in that evolution. Content production has given rise to rapid job creation in recent years and continues to do so. Most of those jobs are created by innovative start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). (13) One of the principal aims of the establishment of an internal market is the creation of conditions conducive to the development of services and products Union-wide and within Member States. Public sector information or information collected, produced, reproduced, and disseminated within the exercise of a public task or a service of general interest, is an important primary material for digital content products and services and will become an even more important content resource with the development of advanced digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, distributed ledger technologies and the internet of things. Broad, cross-border geographical coverage will also be essential in that context. Increased possibilities of re-using such information is expected, inter alia, to allow all Union businesses, including microenterprises and SMEs, as well as civil society, to exploit its potential and contribute to economic development and high-quality job creation and protection, especially for the benefit of local communities, and to important societal goals such as accountability and transparency. (14) Allowing the re-use of documents held by a public sector body adds value for the benefit of re-users, end users and society in general and in many cases for the benefit of the public sector body itself, by promoting transparency and accountability and by providing feedback from re-users and end users, which allows the public sector body concerned to improve the quality of the information collected and the performance of its tasks. (15) There are considerable differences in the rules and practices in the Member States relating to the exploitation of public sector information resources, which constitute barriers to bringing out the full economic potential of that key document resource. The fact that practice in public sector bodies in exploiting public sector information continues to vary among Member States should be taken into account. Minimum harmonisation of national rules and practices on the re-use of public sector documents should therefore be pursued where the differences in national regulations and practices or the absence of clarity hinder the smooth functioning of the internal market and the proper development of the information society in the Union. (16) Open data as a concept is generally understood to denote data in an open format that can be freely used, re-used and shared by anyone for any purpose. Open data policies which encourage the wide availability and re-use of public sector information for private or commercial purposes, with minimal or no legal, technical or financial constraints, and which promote the circulation of information not only for economic operators but primarily for the public, can play an important role in promoting social engagement, and kick-start and promote the development of new services based on novel ways to combine and make use of such information. Member States are therefore encouraged to promote the creation of data based on the principle of open by design and by default, with regard to all documents falling within the scope of this Directive. In doing so they should ensure a consistent level of protection of public interest objectives, such as public security, including where sensitive critical infrastructure protection related information are concerned. They should also ensure the protection of personal data, including where information in an individual data set does not present a risk of identifying or singling out a natural person, but when that information is combined with other available information, it could entail such a risk. (17) Moreover, without minimum harmonisation at Union level, legislative activity at national level, which has already been initiated in a number of Member States in order to respond to the technological challenges, might result in even more significant divergence. The impact of such legislative divergence and uncertainties will become more significant with the further development of the information society, which has already greatly increased cross-border exploitation of information. (18) Member States have established re-use policies under Directive 2003/98/EC and some of them have been adopting ambitious open data approaches to make the re-use of accessible public data easier for citizens and legal entities beyond the minimum level set by that Directive. There is a risk that diverging rules across Member States act as a barrier to the cross-border offer of products and services and prevent comparable public data sets from being re-usable for pan-Union applications based on them. Therefore, minimum harmonisation is required to determine what public data are available for re-use in the internal information market, consistent with and not affecting the relevant access regimes, both general and sectoral, such as that defined in Directive 2003/4/EC. The provisions of Union and national law that go beyond those minimum requirements, in particular in cases of sectoral law, should continue to apply. Examples of provisions that exceed the minimum harmonisation level of this Directive include lower thresholds for permissible charges for re-use than the thresholds provided for in this Directive or less restrictive licensing terms than those referred to in this Directive. In particular, this Directive is without prejudice to provisions that exceed the minimum harmonisation level of this Directive as laid down in Commission delegated regulations adopted under Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). (19) Moreover, Member States are encouraged to go beyond the minimum requirements set out in this Directive by applying its requirements to documents held by public undertakings, which are related to activities that have been found, pursuant to Article 34 of Directive 2014/25/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), to be directly exposed to competition. Member States may also decide to apply the requirements of this Directive to private undertakings, in particular those that provide services of general interest. (20) A general framework for the conditions governing re-use of public sector documents is needed in order to ensure fair, proportionate and non-discriminatory conditions for the re-use of such information. Public sector bodies collect, produce, reproduce and disseminate documents to fulfil their public tasks. Public undertakings collect, produce, reproduce and disseminate documents to provide services in the general interest. Use of such documents for other reasons constitutes re-use. Member States' policies can go beyond the minimum standards established in this Directive, thus allowing for more extensive re-use. When transposing this Directive, Member States can use terms other than document, provided that they retain the full scope of the definition of document set out in this Directive. (21) This Directive should apply to documents the supply of which forms part of the public tasks of the public sector bodies concerned, as defined by law or by other binding rules in the Member States. In the absence of such rules the public tasks should be defined in accordance with common administrative practice in the Member States, provided that the scope of the public tasks is transparent and subject to review. The public tasks could be defined generally or on a case-by-case basis for individual public sector bodies. (22) This Directive should apply to documents that are made accessible for re-use when public sector bodies license, sell, disseminate, exchange or provide information. To avoid cross-subsidies, re-use should include further use of documents within the organisation itself for activities falling outside the scope of its public tasks. Activities falling outside the public task typically include supply of documents that are produced and charged for exclusively on a commercial basis and in competition with others in the market. (23) This Directive does not restrict or impair the performance of the statutory tasks of public authorities and other public sector bodies. This Directive lays down an obligation for Member States to make all existing documents re-usable unless access is restricted or excluded under national rules on access to documents or subject to the other exceptions laid down in this Directive. This Directive builds on the existing access regimes in the Member States and does not change the national rules for access to documents. It does not apply to cases in which citizens or legal entities can, under the relevant access regime, obtain a document only if they can prove a particular interest. At Union level, Article 41 on the right to good administration and Article 42 on the right of access to documents in the Charter recognise the right of any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State to have access to documents held by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Public sector bodies should be encouraged to make available for re-use any documents held by them. Public sector bodies should promote and encourage re-use of documents, including official texts of a legislative and administrative nature in those cases where the public sector body has the right to authorise their re-use. (24) Member States often entrust the provision of services in the general interest with entities outside of the public sector while maintaining a high degree of control over such entities. At the same time, Directive 2003/98/EC applies only to documents held by public sector bodies, while excluding public undertakings from its scope. This leads to poor availability for re-use of documents produced in the performance of services in the general interest in a number of areas, in particular in the utility sectors. It also greatly reduces the potential for the creation of cross-border services based on documents held by public undertakings that provide services in the general interest. (25) Directive 2003/98/EC should therefore be amended in order to ensure that it can be applied to the re-use of existing documents produced in the performance of services in the general interest by public undertakings pursuing one of the activities referred to in Articles 8 to 14 of Directive 2014/25/EU, as well as by public undertakings acting as public service operators pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), public undertakings acting as air carriers fulfilling public service obligations pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), and public undertakings acting as Community shipowners fulfilling public service obligations pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 (13). (26) This Directive does not contain a general obligation to allow the re-use of documents produced by public undertakings. The decision whether or not to authorise re-use should remain with the public undertaking concerned, except where otherwise required by this Directive or by Union or national law. Only after the public undertaking has made a document available for re-use, should it observe the relevant obligations laid down in Chapters III and IV of this Directive, in particular as regards format, charging, transparency, licences, non-discrimination and prohibition of exclusive arrangements. On the other hand, public undertakings should not be required to comply with the requirements laid down in Chapter II, such as the rules applicable to processing of requests. When allowing the re-use of documents, particular attention should be given to sensitive critical infrastructure protection related information as defined in Council Directive 2008/114/EC (14) and of essential services within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). (27) The volume of research data generated is growing exponentially and has potential for re-use beyond the scientific community. In order to be able to address mounting societal challenges efficiently and in a holistic manner, it has become crucial and urgent to be able to access, blend and re-use data from different sources, as well as across sectors and disciplines. Research data includes statistics, results of experiments, measurements, observations resulting from fieldwork, survey results, interview recordings and images. It also includes meta-data, specifications and other digital objects. Research data is different from scientific articles reporting and commenting on findings resulting from their scientific research. For many years, the open availability and re-usability of scientific research data stemming from public funding has been subject to specific policy initiatives. Open access is understood as the practice of providing online access to research outputs free of charge for the end user and without restrictions on use and re-use beyond the possibility to require acknowledgement of authorship. Open access policies aim in particular to provide researchers and the public at large with access to research data as early as possible in the dissemination process and to facilitate its use and re-use. Open access helps enhance quality, reduce the need for unnecessary duplication of research, speed up scientific progress, combat scientific fraud, and it can overall favour economic growth and innovation. Beside open access, commendable efforts are being made to ensure that data management planning becomes a standard scientific practice and to support the dissemination of research data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (the FAIR principle). (28) For the reasons explained above, it is appropriate to set an obligation on Member States to adopt open access policies with respect to publicly funded research data and ensure that such policies are implemented by all research performing organisations and research funding organisations. Research performing organisations and research funding organisations could also be organised as public sector bodies or public undertakings. This Directive applies to such hybrid organisations only in their capacity as research performing organisations and to their research data. Open access policies typically allow for a range of exceptions from making scientific research results openly available. The Commission Recommendation of 25 April 2018 on access to and preservation of scientific information describes, among other things, relevant elements of open access policies. Additionally, the conditions, under which certain research data can be re-used, should be improved. For that reason, certain obligations stemming from this Directive should be extended to research data resulting from scientific research activities subsidised by public funding or co-funded by public and private-sector entities. Under the national open access policies, publicly funded research data should be made open as the default option. However, in this context, concerns in relation to privacy, protection of personal data, confidentiality, national security, legitimate commercial interests, such as trade secrets, and to intellectual property rights of third parties should be duly taken into account, according to the principle as open as possible, as closed as necessary. Moreover, research data which are excluded from access on grounds of national security, defence or public security should not be covered by this Directive. In order to avoid any administrative burden, obligations stemming from this Directive should apply only to such research data that have already been made publicly available by researchers, research performing organisations or research funding organisations through an institutional or subject-based repository and should not impose extra costs for the retrieval of the datasets or require additional curation of data. Member States may extend the application of this Directive to research data made publicly available through other data infrastructures than repositories, through open access publications, as an attached file to an article, a data paper or a paper in a data journal. Documents other than research data should continue to be exempt from the scope of this Directive. (29) The definition of public sector body is based on the definition in point (1) of Article 2(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (16). The definition of body governed by public law set out in that Directive and the definition of public undertaking set out in Directive 2014/25/EU should apply to this Directive. (30) This Directive lays down the definition of the term document and that definition should include any part of a document. The term document should cover any representation of acts, facts or information  and any compilation of such acts, facts or information  whatever its medium (paper, or electronic form or as a sound, visual or audiovisual recording). The definition of document is not intended to cover computer programmes. Member States may extend the application of this Directive to computer programmes. (31) Public sector bodies are increasingly making their documents available for re-use in a proactive manner, by ensuring online discoverability and actual availability of documents and associated metadata in an open format that can be machine-readable and that ensure interoperability, re-use and accessibility. Documents should also be made available for re-use following a request lodged by a re-user. In those cases, the time limit for replying to requests for re-use should be reasonable and in accordance with the equivalent time for requests to access the document under the relevant access regimes. Public undertakings, educational establishments, research performing organisations and research funding organisations should however be exempt from that requirement. Reasonable time limits throughout the Union will stimulate the creation of new aggregated information products and services at pan-Union level. This is particularly important for dynamic data (including environmental, traffic, satellite, meteorological and sensor generated data), the economic value of which depends on the immediate availability of the information and of regular updates. Dynamic data should therefore be made available immediately after collection, or in the case of a manual update immediately after the modification of the dataset, via an application programming interface (API) so as to facilitate the development of internet, mobile and cloud applications based on such data. Where this is not possible due to technical or financial constraints, public sector bodies should make the documents available in a timeframe that allows their full economic potential to be exploited. Specific measures should be taken in order to lift relevant technical and financial constraints. Should a licence be used, the timely availability of documents may be a part of the terms of the licence. Where data verification is essential in the light of justified public interest reasons, in particular for public health and safety, dynamic data should be made available immediately after verification. Such essential verification should not affect the frequency of the updates. (32) In order to get access to the data opened for re-use by this Directive, it would be useful to ensure access to dynamic data through well-designed APIs. An API is a set of functions, procedures, definitions and protocols for machine-to-machine communication and the seamless exchange of data. APIs should be supported by clear technical documentation that is complete and available online. Where possible, open APIs should be used. Union or internationally recognised standard protocols should be applied and international standards for datasets should be used where applicable. APIs can have different levels of complexity and can mean a simple link to a database to retrieve specific datasets, a web interface, or more complex set-ups. There is general value in re-using and sharing data via a suitable use of APIs as this will help developers and start-ups to create new services and products. It is also a crucial ingredient of creating valuable ecosystems around data assets that are often unused. The set-up and use of API needs to be based on several principles: availability, stability, maintenance over lifecycle, uniformity of use and standards, user-friendliness as well as security. For dynamic data, meaning frequently updated data, often in real time, public sector bodies and public undertakings should make this available for re-use immediately after collection by ways of suitable APIs and, where relevant, as a bulk download, save for cases where this would impose a disproportionate effort. Assessment of the proportionality of the effort should take into account the size and operating budget of the public sector body or the public undertaking in question. (33) The possibilities for re-use can be improved by limiting the need to digitise paper-based documents or to process digital files to make them mutually compatible. Therefore, public sector bodies should make documents available in any pre-existing format or language, through electronic means where possible and appropriate. Public sector bodies should view requests for extracts from existing documents favourably when to grant such a request would involve only a simple operation. Public sector bodies should not, however, be obliged to provide an extract from a document or to modify the format of the requested information where this involves a disproportionate effort. To facilitate re-use, public sector bodies should make their own documents available in a format which, as far as possible and appropriate, is not dependent on the use of specific software. Where possible and appropriate, public sector bodies should take into account the possibilities for the re-use of documents by and for persons with disabilities by providing the information in an accessible format in accordance with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17). (34) To facilitate re-use, public sector bodies should, where possible and appropriate, make documents, including those published on websites, available through an open and machine-readable format and together with their metadata, at the best level of precision and granularity, in a format that ensures interoperability, for example by processing them in a way consistent with the principles governing the compatibility and usability requirements for spatial information under Directive 2007/2/EC. (35) A document should be considered to be in a machine-readable format if it is in a file format that is structured in such a way that software applications can easily identify, recognise and extract specific data from it. Data encoded in files that are structured in a machine-readable format should be considered to be machine-readable data. A machine-readable format can be open or proprietary. They can be formal standards or not. Documents encoded in a file format that limits automatic processing, because the data cannot, or cannot easily, be extracted from them, should not be considered to be in a machine-readable format. Member States should, where possible and appropriate, encourage the use of a Union or internationally recognised open, machine-readable format. The European interoperability framework should be taken into account, where applicable, when designing technical solutions for the re-use of documents. (36) Charges for the re-use of documents constitute an important market entry barrier for start-ups and SMEs. Documents should therefore be made available for re-use free of charge and, where charges are necessary, they should in principle be limited to the marginal costs. Where public sector bodies carry out a particularly extensive search for requested information or extremely costly modifications of the format of requested information, either voluntarily or as required under national law, marginal costs may cover the costs associated with such activities. In exceptional cases, the necessity of not hindering the normal running of public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks should be taken into consideration. This also applies where a public sector body has made data available as open data but is obliged to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of other public tasks. The role of public undertakings in a competitive economic environment should also be acknowledged. In such cases, public sector bodies and public undertakings should therefore be able to charge above marginal costs. Those charges should be set according to objective, transparent and verifiable criteria and the total income from supplying and allowing re-use of documents should not exceed the cost of collection and production, including purchasing from third parties, reproduction, maintenance, storage and dissemination, together with a reasonable return on investment. Where applicable, it should also be possible to include in the eligible cost the costs of anonymisation of personal data and costs of measures taken to protect the confidentiality of data. Member States may require public sector bodies and public undertakings to disclose those costs. The requirement to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of the public sector bodies' costs relating to the performance of their public tasks or the scope of the services of general interest entrusted with public undertakings does not have to be a legal requirement and may stem, for example, from administrative practices in Member States. Such a requirement should be regularly reviewed by the Member States. (37) The return on investment can be understood as a percentage, in addition to marginal costs, allowing for the recovery of the cost of capital and the inclusion of a real rate of return. As the cost of capital is closely linked to credit institutions' interest rates, which are themselves based on the fixed rate of the European Central Bank (ECB) on main refinancing operations, the reasonable return on investment should not be more than 5 % above the ECB's fixed interest rate. (38) Libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives should be able to charge above marginal costs in order not to hinder their normal running. In the case of such public sector bodies, the total income from supplying and allowing re-use of documents over the appropriate accounting period should not exceed the cost of collection, production, reproduction, dissemination, preservation and rights clearance, together with a reasonable return on investment. Where applicable, the costs of anonymisation of personal data or of commercially sensitive information should also be included in the eligible cost. For the purpose of libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives, and bearing in mind their particularities, the prices charged by the private sector for the re-use of identical or similar documents could be considered when calculating a reasonable return on investment. (39) The upper limits for charges set in this Directive are without prejudice to the right of Member States to apply lower charges or no charges at all. (40) Member States should lay down the criteria for charging above marginal costs. For example, they should be able to lay down such criteria in national rules or to designate an appropriate body or appropriate bodies, other than the public sector body itself, competent to lay down such criteria. That body should be organised in accordance with the constitutional and legal systems of the Member States. It could be an existing body with budgetary executive powers and under political responsibility. (41) Ensuring that the conditions for re-use of public sector documents are clear and publicly available is a pre-condition for the development of a Union-wide information market. Therefore, all applicable conditions for the re-use of documents should be made clear to the potential re-users. Member States should encourage the creation of indices accessible on line, where appropriate, of available documents so as to promote and facilitate requests for re-use. Applicants for re-use of documents held by entities other than public undertakings, educational establishments, research performing organisations and research funding organisations should be informed of available means of redress relating to decisions or practices affecting them. This will be particularly important for start-ups and SMEs, which may not be familiar with interactions with public sector bodies from other Member States and corresponding means of redress. (42) The means of redress should include the possibility of review by an impartial review body. That body could be an already existing national authority, such as the national competition authority, the supervisory authority established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the national access to documents authority or a national judicial authority. That body should be organised in accordance with the constitutional and legal systems of Member States. Recourse to that body should not pre-empt any means of redress otherwise available to applicants for re-use. It should however be distinct from the Member State mechanism laying down the criteria for charging above marginal costs. The means of redress should include the possibility of review of negative decisions but also of decisions which, although permitting re-use, could still affect applicants on other grounds, in particular by the charging rules applied. The review process should be swift, in accordance with the needs of a rapidly changing market. (43) Making public all generally available documents held by the public sector  concerning not only the political process but also the legal and administrative process  is a fundamental instrument for extending the right to knowledge, which is a basic principle of democracy. That objective is applicable to institutions at every level, be it local, national or international. (44) The re-use of documents should not be subject to conditions. However, in some cases justified by a public interest objective, a licence may be issued imposing conditions on the re-use by the licensee dealing with issues such as liability, the protection of personal data, the proper use of documents, guaranteeing non-alteration and the acknowledgement of source. If public sector bodies license documents for re-use, the licence conditions should be objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory. Standard licences that are available online may also play an important role in this respect. Therefore Member States should provide for the availability of standard licences. Any licences for the re-use of public sector information should, in any event, place as few restrictions on re-use as possible, for example limiting restrictions to an indication of source. Open licences in the form of standardised public licences available online which allow data and content to be freely accessed, used, modified and shared by anyone for any purpose, and which rely on open data formats, should play an important role in this respect. Therefore, Member States should encourage the use of open licences that should eventually become common practice across the Union. Without prejudice to liability requirements laid down in Union or national law where a public sector body or a public undertaking makes documents available for re-use without any other conditions or restrictions, that public sector body or public undertaking may be allowed to waive all liability with regards to the documents made available for re-use. (45) If the competent authority decides no longer to make available certain documents for re-use, or to cease updating those documents, it should make those decisions publicly known, at the earliest opportunity, by electronic means where possible. (46) Conditions for re-use should be non-discriminatory for comparable categories of re-use. In that regard, the prohibition of discrimination should not, for example, prevent the exchange of information between public sector bodies free of charge for the exercise of public tasks, whilst other parties are charged for re-use of the same documents. Neither should it prevent the adoption of a differentiated charging policy for commercial and non-commercial re-use. (47) Member States should in particular ensure that re-use of documents of public undertakings does not lead to market distortion and that fair competition is not undermined. (48) Public sector bodies should comply with Union and national competition rules when establishing the principles for re-use of documents avoiding as far as possible exclusive agreements between themselves and private partners. However, in order to provide a service of general economic interest, an exclusive right to re-use specific public sector documents may sometimes be necessary. This may be the case if no commercial publisher would publish the information without such an exclusive right. In this regard, it is appropriate to take into account public service contracts that are excluded from the scope of Directive 2014/24/EU pursuant to Article 11 of that Directive and innovation partnerships as referred to in Article 31 of Directive 2014/24/EU. (49) There are numerous cooperation arrangements between libraries, including university libraries, museums, archives and private partners, which involve digitisation of cultural resources granting exclusive rights to private partners. Practice has shown that such public-private partnerships can facilitate worthwhile use of cultural collections and at the same time accelerate access to the cultural heritage for members of the public. It is therefore appropriate to take into account current divergences between Member States with regard to digitisation of cultural resources, by a specific set of rules pertaining to agreements on digitisation of such resources. Where an exclusive right relates to digitisation of cultural resources, a certain period of exclusivity might be necessary in order to give the private partner the possibility to recoup its investment. That period should, however, be limited to as short a time as possible in order to comply with the principle that public domain material should stay in the public domain once it is digitised. The period of an exclusive right to digitise cultural resources should in general not exceed 10 years. Any period of exclusivity longer than 10 years should be subject to review, taking into account technological, financial and administrative changes in the environment since the arrangement was entered into. In addition, any public private partnership for the digitisation of cultural resources should grant the partner cultural institution full rights with respect to the post-termination use of digitised cultural resources. (50) Arrangements between data holders and data re-users which do not expressly grant exclusive rights but which can reasonably be expected to restrict the availability of documents for re-use should be subject to additional public scrutiny. The essential aspects of such arrangements should therefore be published online at least two months before coming into effect, namely two months before the agreed date on which the performance of the obligations of the parties is set to begin. The publication should give interested parties an opportunity to request the re-use of the documents covered by those arrangements and prevent the risk of restricting the range of potential re-users. In any event, the essential aspects of such arrangements in their final form agreed by the parties should also be made public online without undue delay following their conclusion. (51) This Directive aims to minimise the risk of excessive first-mover advantage that could limit the number of potential re-users of the data. Where contractual arrangements are likely, in addition to a Member State's obligations under this Directive to grant documents, to entail a transfer of that Member State's resources within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, this Directive should be without prejudice to the application of the competition and State aid rules laid down in Articles 101 to 109 TFEU. It follows from the State aid rules laid down in Articles 107, 108 and 109 TFEU that a Member State must check ex ante whether State aid may be involved in the relevant contractual arrangement and ensure that it complies with the State aid rules. (52) This Directive does not affect the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data under Union and national law, particularly Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18) and including any supplementing provisions of national law. This means, inter alia, that the re-use of personal data is permissible only if the principle of purpose limitation as set out in point (b) of Article 5(1) and Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is met. Anonymous information is information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or is no longer identifiable. Rendering information anonymous is a means of reconciling the interests in making public sector information as re-usable as possible with the obligations under data protection law, but it comes at a cost. It is appropriate to consider that cost to be one of the cost items to be considered to be part of the marginal cost of dissemination as referred to in this Directive. (53) When taking decisions on the scope and conditions for the re-use of public sector documents containing personal data, for example in the health sector, data protection impact assessments may have to be performed in accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (54) The intellectual property rights of third parties are not affected by this Directive. For the avoidance of doubt, the term intellectual property rights refers to copyright and related rights only, including sui generis forms of protection. This Directive does not apply to documents covered by industrial property rights, such as patents and registered designs and trade marks. The Directive neither affects the existence or ownership of intellectual property rights of public sector bodies, nor does it limit the exercise of these rights in any way beyond the boundaries set by this Directive. The obligations imposed in accordance with this Directive should apply only insofar as they are compatible with international agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights, in particular the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Berne Convention), the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT). Public sector bodies should, however, exercise their copyright in a way that facilitates re-use. (55) Taking into account Union law and the international obligations of Member States and of the Union, particularly under the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement, documents for which third parties hold intellectual property rights should be excluded from the scope of this Directive. If a third party was the initial owner of the intellectual property rights for a document held by libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives and the term of protection of those rights has not expired, that document should, for the purpose of this Directive, be considered to be a document for which third parties hold intellectual property rights. (56) This Directive should be without prejudice to the rights, including economic and moral rights, that employees of public sector bodies may enjoy under national law. (57) Moreover, where any document is made available for re-use, the public sector body concerned should retain the right to exploit that document. (58) This Directive is without prejudice to Directive 2014/24/EU. (59) Tools that help potential re-users to find documents available for re-use and the conditions for re-use can facilitate considerably the cross-border use of public sector documents. Member States should therefore ensure that practical arrangements are in place that help re-users in their search for documents available for re-use. Examples of such practical arrangements are assets lists, which should preferably be accessible online, of main documents (documents that are extensively re-used or that have the potential to be extensively re-used), and portal sites that are linked to decentralised assets lists. Member States should also facilitate the long-term availability for re-use of public sector information, in accordance with the applicable preservation policies. (60) The Commission should facilitate the cooperation among Member States and support the design, testing, implementation and deployment of interoperable electronic interfaces that enable more efficient and secure public services. (61) This Directive is without prejudice to Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (19). It provides for conditions within which public sector bodies can exercise their intellectual property rights in the internal information market when allowing re-use of documents. Where public sector bodies are holders of the right provided for in Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC, they should not exercise that right in order to prevent re-use or to restrict the re-use of existing documents beyond the limits provided for in this Directive. (62) The Commission has supported the development of an online open data maturity report with relevant performance indicators for the re-use of public sector information in all the Member States. A regular update of that report will contribute to the exchange of information between the Member States and the availability of information on policies and practices across the Union. (63) It is necessary to ensure that the Member States monitor the extent of the re-use of public sector information, the conditions under which it is made available, and the redress practices. (64) The Commission may assist the Member States in implementing this Directive in a consistent way by issuing and updating existing guidelines, particularly on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the re-use of documents, after consulting interested parties. (65) One of the principal aims of the establishment of the internal market is the creation of conditions conducive to the development of Union-wide services. Libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives hold a significant amount of valuable public sector information resources, in particular since digitisation projects have multiplied the amount of digital public domain material. Those cultural heritage collections and related metadata are a potential base for digital content products and services and have a huge potential for innovative re-use in sectors such as learning and tourism. Other types of cultural establishment, such as orchestras, operas, ballets and theatres, including the archives that are part of those establishments, should remain outside the scope of this Directive because of their specificity as performing arts and the fact that almost all of their material is subject to third-party intellectual property rights. (66) In order to provide for conditions supporting the re-use of documents which is associated with important socioeconomic benefits having a particular high value for the economy and society, a list of thematic categories of high-value datasets should be set out in an Annex. By way of illustration, and without prejudice to the implementing acts identifying the high-value datasets to which the specific requirements set out in this Directive should apply, taking into account the Commission guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the reuse of documents, the thematic categories could, inter alia, cover postcodes, national and local maps (geospatial), energy consumption and satellite images (earth observation and environment), in situ data from instruments and weather forecasts (meteorological), demographic and economic indicators (statistics), business registers and registration identifiers (companies and company ownership), road signs and inland waterways (mobility). (67) In order to amend the list of thematic categories of high-value datasets by adding further thematic categories, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (20). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (68) An Union-wide list of datasets with a particular potential to generate socioeconomic benefits together with harmonised re-use conditions constitutes an important enabler of cross-border data applications and services. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to support the re-use of documents associated with important socioeconomic benefits by adopting a list of specific high-value datasets to which specific requirements of this Directive apply, along with the arrangements for their publication and re-use. Consequently, those specific requirements will not apply prior to the adoption by the Commission of implementing acts. The list should take into account sectoral Union legal acts that regulate the publication of datasets, such as Directives 2007/2/EC and 2010/40/EU, to ensure that datasets are made available under corresponding standards and sets of metadata. The list should be based on the thematic categories set out in this Directive. In preparing the list, the Commission should carry out appropriate consultations, including at expert level. Moreover, when deciding on the inclusion in the list of data held by public undertakings or on their free availability, the effects on competition in the relevant markets should be taken into account. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21). (69) For the purpose of ensuring their maximum impact and to facilitate re-use, the high-value datasets should be made available for re-use with minimal legal restrictions and free of charge. They should also be published via APIs. However, this does not preclude public sector bodies from charging for services that they provide in relation to the high-value datasets in their exercise of public authority, in particular certifying the authenticity or veracity of documents. (70) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to facilitate the creation of Union-wide information products and services based on public sector documents, to ensure the effective cross-border use of public sector documents on the one hand by private businesses, particularly by SMEs, for added-value information products and services, and on the other hand by citizens to facilitate the free circulation of information and communication, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the pan-Union scope of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (71) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter, including the right to privacy, the protection of personal data, the right to property and the integration of persons with disabilities. Nothing in this Directive should be interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. (72) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) and delivered an opinion on 10 July 2018 (23). (73) The Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Directive. Pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making, that evaluation should be based on the five criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, coherence and value added and should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action. (74) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limit for the transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 Subject matter and scope 1.

This Directive does not apply to: (a) documents the supply of which is an activity falling outside the scope of the public task of the public sector bodies concerned as defined by law or by other binding rules in the Member State, or, in the absence of such rules, as defined in accordance with common administrative practice in the Member State in question, provided that the scope of the public tasks is transparent and subject to review; (b) documents held by public undertakings: (i) produced outside the scope of the provision of services in the general interest as defined by law or other binding rules in the Member State; (ii) related to activities directly exposed to competition and therefore, pursuant to Article 34 of Directive 2014/25/EU, not subject to procurement rules; (c) documents for which third parties hold intellectual property rights; (d) documents, such as sensitive data, which are excluded from access by virtue of the access regimes in the Member State, including on grounds of: (i) the protection of national security (namely, State security), defence, or public security; (ii) statistical confidentiality; (iii) commercial confidentiality (including business, professional or company secrets); (e) documents access to which is excluded or restricted on grounds of sensitive critical infrastructure protection related information as defined in point (d) of Article 2 of Directive 2008/114/EC; (f) documents access to which is restricted by virtue of the access regimes in the Member States, including cases whereby citizens or legal entities have to prove a particular interest to obtain access to documents; (g) logos, crests and insignia; (h) documents, access to which is excluded or restricted by virtue of the access regimes on grounds of protection of personal data, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain personal data the re-use of which has been defined by law as being incompatible with the law concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data or as undermining the protection of privacy and the integrity of the individual, in particular in accordance with Union or national law regarding the protection of personal data; (i) documents held by public service broadcasters and their subsidiaries, and by other bodies or their subsidiaries for the fulfilment of a public service broadcasting remit; (j) documents held by cultural establishments other than libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives; (k) documents held by educational establishments of secondary level and below, and, in the case of all other educational establishments, documents other than those referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1; (l) documents other than those referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1 held by research performing organisations and research funding organisations, including organisations established for the transfer of research results. 3. This Directive builds on, and is without prejudice to, Union and national access regimes. 4. This Directive is without prejudice to Union and national law on the protection of personal data, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC and the corresponding provisions of national law. 5. The obligations imposed in accordance with this Directive shall apply only insofar as they are compatible with the provisions of international agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights, in particular the Berne Convention, the TRIPS Agreement and the WCT. 6. The right for the maker of a database provided for in Article 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC shall not be exercised by public sector bodies in order to prevent the re-use of documents or to restrict re-use beyond the limits set by this Directive. 7. This Directive governs the re-use of existing documents held by public sector bodies and public undertakings of the Member States, including documents to which Directive 2007/2/EC applies. Article 2 Definitions For the purpose of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (1) public sector body means the State, regional or local authorities, bodies governed by public law or associations formed by one or more such authorities or one or more such bodies governed by public law; (2) bodies governed by public law means bodies that have all of the following characteristics: (a) they are established for the specific purpose of meeting needs in the general interest, not having an industrial or commercial character; (b) they have legal personality; and (c) they are financed, for the most part by the State, regional or local authorities, or by other bodies governed by public law; or are subject to management supervision by those authorities or bodies; or have an administrative, managerial or supervisory board, more than half of whose members are appointed by the State, regional or local authorities, or by other bodies governed by public law; (3) public undertaking means any undertaking active in the areas set out in point (b) of Article 1(1) over which the public sector bodies may exercise directly or indirectly a dominant influence by virtue of their ownership of it, their financial participation therein, or the rules which govern it. A dominant influence on the part of the public sector bodies shall be presumed in any of the following cases in which those bodies, directly or indirectly: (a) hold the majority of the undertaking's subscribed capital; (b) control the majority of the votes attaching to shares issued by the undertaking; (c) can appoint more than half of the undertaking's administrative, management or supervisory body; (4) university means any public sector body that provides post-secondary-school higher education leading to academic degrees; (5) standard licence means a set of predefined re-use conditions in a digital format, preferably compatible with standardised public licences available online; (6) document means: (a) any content whatever its medium (paper or electronic form or as a sound, visual or audiovisual recording); or (b) any part of such content; (7) anonymisation means the process of changing documents into anonymous documents which do not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person, or the process of rendering personal data anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable; (8) dynamic data means documents in a digital form, subject to frequent or real-time updates, in particular because of their volatility or rapid obsolescence; data generated by sensors are typically considered to be dynamic data; (9) research data means documents in a digital form, other than scientific publications, which are collected or produced in the course of scientific research activities and are used as evidence in the research process, or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results; (10) high-value datasets means documents the re-use of which is associated with important benefits for society, the environment and the economy, in particular because of their suitability for the creation of value-added services, applications and new, high-quality and decent jobs, and of the number of potential beneficiaries of the value-added services and applications based on those datasets; (11) re-use means the use by persons or legal entities of documents held by: (a) public sector bodies, for commercial or non-commercial purposes other than the initial purpose within the public task for which the documents were produced, except for the exchange of documents between public sector bodies purely in pursuit of their public tasks; or (b) public undertakings, for commercial or non-commercial purposes other than for the initial purpose of providing services in the general interest for which the documents were produced, except for the exchange of documents between public undertakings and public sector bodies purely in pursuit of the public tasks of public sector bodies; (12) personal data means personal data as defined in point (1) of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679; (13) machine-readable format means a file format structured so that software applications can easily identify, recognise and extract specific data, including individual statements of fact, and their internal structure; (14) open format means a file format that is platform-independent and made available to the public without any restriction that impedes the re-use of documents; (15) formal open standard means a standard which has been laid down in written form, detailing specifications for the requirements on how to ensure software interoperability; (16) reasonable return on investment means a percentage of the overall charge, in addition to that needed to recover the eligible costs, not exceeding 5 percentage points above the fixed interest rate of the ECB; (17) third party means any natural or legal person other than a public sector body or a public undertaking that holds the data. Article 3 General principle 1. Subject to paragraph 2 of this Article, Member States shall ensure that documents to which this Directive applies in accordance with Article 1 shall be re-usable for commercial or non-commercial purposes in accordance with Chapters III and IV. 2. For documents in which libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives hold intellectual property rights and for documents held by public undertakings, Member States shall ensure that, where the re-use of such documents is allowed, those documents shall be re-usable for commercial or non-commercial purposes in accordance with Chapters III and IV. CHAPTER II REQUESTS FOR RE-USE Article 4 Processing of requests for re-use 1. Public sector bodies shall, through electronic means where possible and appropriate, process requests for re-use and shall make the document available for re-use to the applicant or, if a licence is needed, finalise the licence offer to the applicant within a reasonable time that is consistent with the time frames laid down for the processing of requests for access to documents. 2. Where no time limits or other rules regulating the timely provision of documents have been established, public sector bodies shall process the request and shall deliver the documents for re-use to the applicant or, if a licence is needed, finalise the licence offer to the applicant as soon as possible, and in any event within 20 working days of receipt. That time frame may be extended by a further 20 working days in the case of extensive or complex requests. In such cases, the applicant shall be notified as soon as possible, and in any event within three weeks of the initial request, that more time is needed to process the request and the reasons why. 3. In the event of a negative decision, the public sector bodies shall communicate the grounds for refusal to the applicant on the basis of the relevant provisions of the access regime in that Member State or of the provisions transposing this Directive, in particular points (a) to (h) of Article 1(2) or Article 3. Where a negative decision is based on point (c) of Article 1(2), the public sector body shall include a reference to the natural or legal person who is the rightsholder, where known, or alternatively to the licensor from which the public sector body has obtained the relevant material. Libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives, shall not be required to include such a reference. 4. Any decision on re-use shall contain a reference to the means of redress where the applicant wishes to challenge the decision. The means of redress shall include the possibility of review by an impartial review body with the appropriate expertise, such as the national competition authority, the relevant access to documents authority, the supervisory authority established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or a national judicial authority, whose decisions are binding upon the public sector body concerned. 5. For the purposes of this Article, Member States shall establish practical arrangements to facilitate effective re-use of documents. Those arrangements may in particular include the means to supply adequate information on the rights provided for in this Directive and to offer relevant assistance and guidance. 6. The following entities shall not be required to comply with this Article: (a) public undertakings; (b) educational establishments, research performing organisations and research funding organisations. CHAPTER III CONDITIONS FOR RE-USE Article 5 Available formats 1. Without prejudice to Chapter V, public sector bodies and public undertakings shall make their documents available in any pre-existing format or language and, where possible and appropriate, by electronic means, in formats that are open, machine-readable, accessible, findable and re-usable, together with their metadata. Both the format and the metadata shall, where possible, comply with formal open standards. 2. Member States shall encourage public sector bodies and public undertakings to produce and make available documents falling within the scope of this Directive in accordance with the principle of open by design and by default. 3. Paragraph 1 shall not imply an obligation for public sector bodies to create or adapt documents or provide extracts in order to comply with that paragraph where this would involve disproportionate effort, going beyond a simple operation. 4. Public sector bodies shall not be required to continue the production and storage of a certain type of document with a view to the re-use of such documents by a private or public sector organisation. 5. Public sector bodies shall make dynamic data available for re-use immediately after collection, via suitable APIs and, where relevant, as a bulk download. 6. Where making dynamic data available for re-use immediately after collection, as referred to in paragraph 5, would exceed the financial and technical capacities of the public sector body, thereby imposing a disproportionate effort, those dynamic data shall be made available for re-use within a time frame or with temporary technical restrictions that do not unduly impair the exploitation of their economic and social potential. 7. Paragraphs 1 to 6 shall apply to existing documents held by public undertakings which are available for re-use. 8. The high-value datasets, as listed in accordance with Article 14(1) shall be made available for re-use in machine-readable format, via suitable APIs and, where relevant, as a bulk download. Article 6 Principles governing charging 1. The re-use of documents shall be free of charge. However, the recovery of the marginal costs incurred for the reproduction, provision and dissemination of documents as well as for anonymisation of personal data and measures taken to protect commercially confidential information may be allowed. 2. By way of exception, paragraph 1 shall not apply to the following: (a) public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks; (b) libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives; (c) public undertakings. 3. Member States shall publish online a list of the public sector bodies referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2. 4. In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the total charges shall be calculated in accordance with objective, transparent and verifiable criteria. Such criteria shall be laid down by Member States. The total income from supplying and allowing the re-use of documents over the appropriate accounting period shall not exceed the cost of their collection, production, reproduction, dissemination and data storage, together with a reasonable return on investment, and  where applicable  the anonymisation of personal data and measures taken to protect commercially confidential information. Charges shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting principles. 5. Where charges are made by the public sector bodies referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2, the total income from supplying and allowing the re-use of documents over the appropriate accounting period shall not exceed the cost of collection, production, reproduction, dissemination, data storage, preservation and rights clearance and, where applicable, the anonymisation of personal data and measures taken to protect commercially confidential information, together with a reasonable return on investment. Charges shall be calculated in accordance with the accounting principles applicable to the public sector bodies involved. 6. The re-use of the following shall be free of charge for the user: (a) subject to Article 14(3), (4) and (5), the high-value datasets, as listed in accordance with paragraph 1 of that Article; (b) research data referred to in point (c) of Article 1(1). Article 7 Transparency 1. In the case of standard charges for the re-use of documents, any applicable conditions and the actual amount of those charges, including the calculation basis for such charges, shall be pre-established and published, through electronic means where possible and appropriate. 2. In the case of charges for the re-use other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the factors that are taken into account in the calculation of those charges shall be indicated at the outset. Upon request, the holder of the documents in question shall also indicate the way in which such charges have been calculated in relation to a specific re-use request. 3. Public sector bodies shall ensure that applicants for re-use of documents are informed of available means of redress relating to decisions or practices affecting them. Article 8 Standard licences 1. The re-use of documents shall not be subject to conditions, unless such conditions are objective, proportionate, non-discriminatory and justified on grounds of a public interest objective. When re-use is subject to conditions, those conditions shall not unnecessarily restrict possibilities for re-use and shall not be used to restrict competition. 2. In Member States where licences are used, Member States shall ensure that standard licences for the re-use of public sector documents, which can be adapted to meet particular licence applications, are available in digital format and can be processed electronically. Member States shall encourage the use of such standard licences. Article 9 Practical arrangements 1. Member States shall make practical arrangements facilitating the search for documents available for re-use, such as asset lists of main documents with relevant metadata, accessible where possible and appropriate online and in machine-readable format, and portal sites that are linked to the asset lists. Where possible, Member States shall facilitate the cross-linguistic search for documents, in particular by enabling metadata aggregation at Union level. Member States shall also encourage public sector bodies to make practical arrangements facilitating the preservation of documents available for re-use. 2. Member States shall, in cooperation with the Commission, continue efforts to simplify access to datasets, in particular by providing a single point of access and by progressively making available suitable datasets held by public sector bodies with regard to the documents to which this Directive applies, as well as to data held by Union institutions, in formats that are accessible, readily findable and re-usable by electronic means. Article 10 Research data 1. Member States shall support the availability of research data by adopting national policies and relevant actions aiming at making publicly funded research data openly available (open access policies), following the principle of open by default and compatible with the FAIR principles. In that context, concerns relating to intellectual property rights, personal data protection and confidentiality, security and legitimate commercial interests, shall be taken into account in accordance with the principle of as open as possible, as closed as necessary. Those open access policies shall be addressed to research performing organisations and research funding organisations. 2. Without prejudice to point (c) of Article 1(2), research data shall be re-usable for commercial or non-commercial purposes in accordance with Chapters III and IV, insofar as they are publicly funded and researchers, research performing organisations or research funding organisations have already made them publicly available through an institutional or subject-based repository. In that context, legitimate commercial interests, knowledge transfer activities and pre-existing intellectual property rights shall be taken into account. CHAPTER IV NON-DISCRIMINATION AND FAIR TRADING Article 11 Non-discrimination 1. Any applicable conditions for the re-use of documents shall be non-discriminatory for comparable categories of re-use, including for cross-border re-use. 2. If documents are re-used by a public sector body as input for its commercial activities which fall outside the scope of its public tasks, the same charges and other conditions shall apply to the supply of the documents for those activities as apply to other users. Article 12 Exclusive arrangements 1. The re-use of documents shall be open to all potential actors in the market, even if one or more market actors already exploit added-value products based on those documents. Contracts or other arrangements between the public sector bodies or public undertakings holding the documents and third parties shall not grant exclusive rights. 2. However, where an exclusive right is necessary for the provision of a service in the public interest, the validity of the reason for granting such an exclusive right shall be subject to regular review, and shall, in any event, be reviewed every three years. The exclusive arrangements established on or after 16 July 2019 shall be made publicly available online at least two months before they come into effect. The final terms of such arrangements shall be transparent and shall made publicly available online. This paragraph shall not apply to digitisation of cultural resources. 3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where an exclusive right relates to the digitisation of cultural resources, the period of exclusivity shall in general not exceed 10 years. Where that period exceeds 10 years, its duration shall be subject to review during the 11th year and, if applicable, every seven years thereafter. The arrangements granting exclusive rights referred to in the first subparagraph shall be transparent and made public. In the case of an exclusive right referred to in the first subparagraph, the public sector body concerned shall be provided free of charge with a copy of the digitised cultural resources as part of those arrangements. That copy shall be available for re-use at the end of the period of exclusivity. 4. Legal or practical arrangements that, without expressly granting an exclusive right, aim at, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a restricted availability for the re-use of documents by entities other than the third party participating in the arrangement, shall be made publicly available online at least two months before their coming into effect. The effect of such legal or practical arrangements on the availability of data for re-use shall be subject to regular reviews and shall, in any event, be reviewed every three years. The final terms of such arrangements shall be transparent and made publicly available online. 5. Exclusive arrangements existing on 17 July 2013 that do not qualify for the exceptions set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 and that were entered into by public sector bodies shall be terminated at the end of the contract and in any event not later than on 18 July 2043. Exclusive arrangements existing on 16 July 2019 that do not qualify for the exceptions set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, and that were entered into by public undertakings, shall be terminated at the end of the contract and in any event not later than on 17 July 2049. CHAPTER V HIGH-VALUE DATASETS Article 13 Thematic categories of high-value datasets 1. In order to provide for conditions to support the re-use of high-value datasets, a list of thematic categories of such datasets is set out in Annex I. 2. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 15 in order to amend Annex I by adding new thematic categories of high-value datasets in order to reflect technological and market developments. Article 14 Specific high-value datasets and arrangements for publication and re-use 1. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down a list of specific high-value datasets belonging to the categories set out in Annex I and held by public sector bodies and public undertakings among the documents to which this Directive applies. Such specific high-value datasets shall be: (a) available free of charge, subject to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5; (b) machine readable; (c) provided via APIs; and (d) provided as a bulk download, where relevant. Those implementing acts may specify the arrangements for the publication and re-use of high-value datasets. Such arrangements shall be compatible with open standard licences. The arrangements may include terms applicable to re-use, formats of data and metadata and technical arrangements for dissemination. Investments made by the Member States in open data approaches, such as investments into the development and roll-out of certain standards, shall be taken into account and balanced against the potential benefits from inclusion in the list. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2). 2. The identification of specific high-value datasets pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be based on the assessment of their potential to: (a) generate significant socioeconomic or environmental benefits and innovative services; (b) benefit a high number of users, in particular SMEs; (c) assist in generating revenues; and (d) be combined with other datasets. For the purpose of identifying such specific high-value datasets, the Commission shall carry out appropriate consultations, including at expert level, conduct an impact assessment and ensure complementarity with existing legal acts, such as Directive 2010/40/EU, with respect to the re-use of documents. That impact assessment shall include a cost-benefit analysis and an analysis of whether providing high-value datasets free of charge by public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks would lead to a substantial impact on the budget of such bodies. With regard to high-value datasets held by public undertakings, the impact assessment shall give special consideration to the role of public undertakings in a competitive economic environment. 3. By way of derogation from point (a) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide that the availability of high-value datasets free of charge is not to apply to specific high-value datasets held by public undertakings where that would lead to a distortion of competition in the relevant markets. 4. The requirement to make high-value datasets available free of charge pursuant to point (a) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall not apply to libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives. 5. Where making high-value datasets available free of charge by public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks would lead to a substantial impact on the budget of the bodies involved, Member States may exempt those bodies from the requirement to make those high-value datasets available free of charge for a period of no more than two years following the entry into force of the relevant implementing act adopted in accordance with paragraph 1. CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 15 Exercise of the delegation 1. The power to adopt delegated acts is conferred on the Commission subject to the conditions laid down in this Article. 2. The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 13(2) shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 16 July 2019. The Commission shall draw up a report in respect of the delegation of power not later than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of an identical duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such extension not later than three months before the end of each period. 3. The delegation of power referred to in Article 13(2) may be revoked at any time by the European Parliament or by the Council. A decision to revoke shall put an end to the delegation of the power specified in that decision.

In the interests of clarity, that Directive should be recast. (2) The internal market for electricity, which has been progressively implemented throughout the Union since 1999, aims, by organising competitive electricity markets across country borders, to deliver real choice for all Union final customers, be they citizens or businesses, new business opportunities, competitive prices, efficient investment signals and higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability. (3) Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Directive 2009/72/EC have made a significant contribution towards the creation of the internal market for electricity. However, the Union's energy system is in the middle of a profound change. The common goal of decarbonising the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market participants. At the same time, technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross-border cooperation. There is a need to adapt the Union market rules to a new market reality. (4) The Commission Communication of 25 February 2015, entitled A Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy, sets out a vision of an Energy Union with citizens at its core, where citizens take ownership of the energy transition, benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills and participate actively in the market, and where vulnerable consumers are protected. (5) The Commission Communication of 15 July 2015, entitled Delivering a New Deal for Energy Consumers, put forward the Commission's vision for a retail market that better serves energy consumers, including by better linking wholesale and retail markets. By taking advantage of new technology, new and innovative energy service companies should enable all consumers to fully participate in the energy transition, managing their consumption to deliver energy efficient solutions which save them money and contribute to the overall reduction of energy consumption. (6) The Commission Communication of 15 July 2015, entitled Launching the public consultation process on a new energy market design, highlighted that the move away from generation in large central generating installations towards decentralised production of electricity from renewable sources and towards decarbonised markets requires adapting the current rules of electricity trading and changing the existing market roles. The Communication underlined the need to organise electricity markets in a more flexible manner and to fully integrate all market players  including producers of renewable energy, new energy service providers, energy storage and flexible demand. It is equally important for the Union to invest urgently in interconnection at Union level for the transfer of energy through high-voltage electricity transmission systems. (7) With a view to creating an internal market for electricity, Member States should foster the integration of their national markets and cooperation among system operators at Union and regional level, and incorporate isolated systems that form electricity islands that persist in the Union. (8) In addition to addressing new challenges, this Directive seeks to address the persisting obstacles to the completion of the internal market for electricity. The refined regulatory framework needs to contribute to overcoming the current problems of fragmented national markets which are still often determined by a high degree of regulatory interventions. Such interventions have led to obstacles to the supply of electricity on equal terms as well as higher costs in comparison to solutions based on cross-border cooperation and market-based principles. (9) The Union would most effectively meet its renewable energy targets through the creation of a market framework that rewards flexibility and innovation. A well-functioning electricity market design is the key factor enabling the uptake of renewable energy. (10) Consumers have an essential role to play in achieving the flexibility necessary to adapt the electricity system to variable and distributed renewable electricity generation. Technological progress in grid management and the generation of renewable electricity has unlocked many opportunities for consumers. Healthy competition in retail markets is essential to ensuring the market-driven deployment of innovative new services that address consumers' changing needs and abilities, while increasing system flexibility. However, the lack of real-time or near real-time information provided to consumers about their energy consumption has prevented them from being active participants in the energy market and the energy transition. By empowering consumers and providing them with the tools to participate more in the energy market, including participating in new ways, it is intended that citizens in the Union benefit from the internal market for electricity and that the Union's renewable energy targets are attained. (11) The freedoms which the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) guarantees the citizens of the Union  inter alia, the free movement of goods, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services  are achievable only in a fully open market, which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers. (12) Promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers is of the utmost importance for Member States in order to allow consumers to take full advantage of the opportunities of a liberalised internal market for electricity. Nonetheless, it is possible that market failure persists in peripheral small electricity systems and in systems not connected with other Member States, where electricity prices fail to provide the right signal to drive investment, and therefore requires specific solutions to ensure an adequate level of security of supply. (13) In order to foster competition and ensure the supply of electricity at the most competitive price, Member States and regulatory authorities should facilitate cross-border access for new suppliers of electricity from different energy sources as well as for new providers of generation, energy storage and demand response. (14) Member States should ensure that no undue barriers exist within the internal market for electricity as regards market entry, operation and exit. At the same time, it should be clarified that that obligation is without prejudice to the competence that Member States retain in relation to third countries. That clarification should not be interpreted as enabling a Member State to exercise the exclusive competence of the Union. It should also be clarified that market participants from third countries who operate within the internal market are to comply with the applicable Union and national law in the same manner as other market participants. (15) Market rules allow for the entry and exit of producers and suppliers based on their assessment of the economic and financial viability of their operations. That principle is not incompatible with the possibility for Member States to impose on undertakings operating in the electricity sector public service obligations in the general economic interest in accordance with the Treaties, in particular with Article 106 TFEU, and with this Directive and Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). (16) The European Council of 23 and 24 October 2014 stated in its conclusions that the Commission, supported by the Member States, is to take urgent measures in order to ensure the achievement of a minimum target of 10 % of existing electricity interconnections, as a matter of urgency, and no later than 2020, at least for Member States which have not yet attained a minimum level of integration in the internal energy market, which are the Baltic States, Portugal and Spain, and for Member States which constitute their main point of access to the internal energy market. It further stated that the Commission is also to report regularly to the European Council with the objective of arriving at a 15 % target by 2030. (17) Sufficient physical interconnection with neighbouring countries is important to enable Member States and neighbouring countries to benefit from the positive effects of the internal market as stressed in the Commission Communication of 23 November 2017, entitled Communication on strengthening Europe's energy networks, and as reflected in Member States' integrated national energy and climate plans under Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). (18) Electricity markets differ from other markets such as those for natural gas, for example because they involve the trading in a commodity which cannot currently be easily stored and which is produced using a large variety of generating installations, including through distributed generation. This has been reflected in the different approaches to the regulatory treatment of interconnectors in the electricity and gas sectors. The integration of electricity markets requires a high degree of cooperation among system operators, market participants and regulatory authorities, in particular where electricity is traded via market coupling. (19) Securing common rules for a true internal market and a broad supply of electricity that is accessible to all should also be one of the main goals of this Directive. To that end, undistorted market prices would provide incentives for cross-border interconnections and for investments in new electricity generation while leading to price convergence in the long term. (20) Market prices should give the right incentives for the development of the network and for investing in new electricity generation. (21) Different types of market organisation exist in the internal market for electricity. The measures that Member States could take in order to ensure a level playing field should be based on overriding requirements of general interest. The Commission should be consulted on the compatibility of those measures with the TFEU and with other Union law. (22) Member States should maintain wide discretion to impose public service obligations on electricity undertakings in pursuing objectives of general economic interest. Member States should ensure that household customers and, where Member States consider it to be appropriate, small enterprises, enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality at clearly comparable, transparent and competitive prices. Nevertheless, public service obligations in the form of price setting for the supply of electricity constitute a fundamentally distortive measure that often leads to the accumulation of tariff deficits, the limitation of consumer choice, poorer incentives for energy saving and energy efficiency investments, lower standards of service, lower levels of consumer engagement and satisfaction, and the restriction of competition, as well as to there being fewer innovative products and services on the market. Consequently, Member States should apply other policy tools, in particular targeted social policy measures, to safeguard the affordability of electricity supply to their citizens. Public interventions in price setting for the supply of electricity should be carried out only as public service obligations and should be subject to specific conditions set out in this Directive. A fully liberalised, well-functioning retail electricity market would stimulate price and non-price competition among existing suppliers and provide incentives to new market entrants, thereby improving consumer choice and satisfaction. (23) Public service obligations in the form of price setting for the supply of electricity should be used without overriding the principle of open markets in clearly defined circumstances and beneficiaries and should be limited in duration. Such circumstances might occur for example where supply is severely constrained, causing significantly higher electricity prices than normal, or in the event of a market failure where interventions by regulatory authorities and competition authorities have proven to be ineffective. This would disproportionately affect households and, in particular, vulnerable customers who typically expend a higher share of their disposable income on energy bills compared to high-income consumers. In order to mitigate the distortive effects of public service obligations in price setting for the supply of electricity, Member States applying such interventions should put in place additional measures, including measures to prevent distortions of price setting in the wholesale market. Member States should ensure that all beneficiaries of regulated prices are able to benefit fully from the offers available on the competitive market when they choose to do so. To that end, those beneficiaries need to be equipped with smart metering systems and have access to dynamic electricity price contracts. In addition, they should be directly and regularly informed of the offers and savings available on the competitive market, in particular relating to dynamic electricity price contracts, and should be provided with assistance to respond to and benefit from market-based offers. (24) The entitlement of beneficiaries of regulated prices to receive individual smart meters without extra costs should not prevent Member States from modifying the functionality of smart metering systems where smart meter infrastructure does not exist because the cost-benefit assessment regarding the deployment of smart metering systems was negative. (25) Public interventions in price setting for the supply of electricity should not lead to direct cross-subsidisation between different categories of customer. According to that principle, price systems must not explicitly make certain categories of customer bear the cost of price interventions that affect other categories of customer. For example, a price system, in which the cost is borne by suppliers or other operators in a non-discriminatory manner, should not be considered to be direct cross-subsidisation. (26) In order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the Union, all measures taken by Member States to achieve the objective of this Directive should be regularly notified to the Commission. The Commission should regularly publish a report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness, with a view to making recommendations as regards measures to be taken at national level to achieve high standards of public service. (27) It should be possible for Member States to appoint a supplier of last resort. That supplier might be the sales division of a vertically integrated undertaking which also performs distribution functions, provided that it meets the unbundling requirements of this Directive. (28) It should be possible for measures implemented by Member States for the purpose of achieving the objectives of social and economic cohesion to include, in particular, the provision of adequate economic incentives, using, where appropriate, any existing national and Union tools. Such tools may include liability mechanisms to guarantee the necessary investment. (29) To the extent that measures taken by Member States to fulfil public service obligations constitute State aid under Article 107(1) TFEU, there is an obligation under Article 108(3) TFEU to notify them to the Commission. (30) Cross sectorial law provides a strong basis for consumer protection for a wide range of energy services that exist, and is likely to evolve. Nevertheless, certain basic contractual rights of customers should be clearly established. (31) Plain and unambiguous information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector. The Commission has established, after consulting relevant stakeholders, including Member States, regulatory authorities, consumer organisations and electricity undertakings, an energy consumer checklist that provides consumers with practical information about their rights. That checklist should be kept up to date, provided to all consumers and made publicly available. (32) Several factors impede consumers from accessing, understanding and acting upon the various sources of market information available to them. It follows that the comparability of offers should be improved and barriers to switching should be minimised to the greatest practicable extent without unduly limiting consumer choice. (33) Smaller customers are still being charged a broad range of fees directly or indirectly as a result of switching supplier. Such fees make it more difficult to identify the best product or service and diminish the immediate financial advantage of switching. Although removing such fees might limit consumer choice by eliminating products based on rewarding consumer loyalty, restricting their use further should improve consumer welfare, consumer engagement and competition in the market. (34) Shorter switching times are likely to encourage consumers to search for better energy deals and switch supplier. With the increased deployment of information technology, by the year 2026, the technical switching process of registering a new supplier in a metering point at the market operator should typically be possible to complete within 24 hours on any working day. Notwithstanding other steps in the switching process that are to be completed before the technical process of switching is initiated, ensuring that it is possible by that date for the technical process of switching to take place within 24 hours would minimise switching times, helping to increase consumer engagement and retail competition. In any event, the total duration of the switching process should not exceed three weeks from the date of the customer's request. (35) Independent comparison tools, including websites, are an effective means for smaller customers to assess the merits of the different energy offers that are available on the market. Such tools lower search costs as customers no longer need to collect information from individual suppliers and service providers. Such tools can provide the right balance between the need for information to be clear and concise and the need for it to be complete and comprehensive. They should aim to include the broadest possible range of available offers, and to cover the market as completely as is feasible so as to give the customer a representative overview. It is crucial that smaller customers have access to at least one comparison tool and that the information given on such tools be trustworthy, impartial and transparent. To that end, Member States could provide for a comparison tool that is operated by a national authority or a private company. (36) Greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availability of effective, independent out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms for all consumers, such as an energy ombudsman, a consumer body or a regulatory authority. Member States should introduce speedy and effective complaint-handling procedures. (37) All consumers should be able to benefit from directly participating in the market, in particular by adjusting their consumption according to market signals and, in return, benefiting from lower electricity prices or other incentive payments. The benefits of such active participation are likely to increase over time, as the awareness of otherwise passive consumers is raised about their possibilities as active customers and as the information on the possibilities of active participation becomes more accessible and better known. Consumers should have the possibility of participating in all forms of demand response. They should therefore have the possibility of benefiting from the full deployment of smart metering systems and, where such deployment has been negatively assessed, of choosing to have a smart metering system and a dynamic electricity price contract. This should allow them to adjust their consumption according to real-time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electricity or transportation in different time periods, while Member States should ensure the reasonable exposure of consumers to wholesale price risk. Consumers should be informed about benefits and potential price risks of dynamic electricity price contracts. Member States should also ensure that those consumers who choose not to actively engage in the market are not penalised. Instead, their ability to make informed decisions on the options available to them should be facilitated in the manner that is the most suited to domestic market conditions. (38) In order to maximise the benefits and effectiveness of dynamic electricity pricing, Member States should assess the potential for making more dynamic or reducing the share of fixed components in electricity bills, and where such potential exists, should take appropriate action. (39) All customer groups (industrial, commercial and households) should have access to the electricity markets to trade their flexibility and self-generated electricity. Customers should be allowed to make full use of the advantages of aggregation of production and supply over larger regions and benefit from cross-border competition. Market participants engaged in aggregation are likely to play an important role as intermediaries between customer groups and the market. Member States should be free to choose the appropriate implementation model and approach to governance for independent aggregation while respecting the general principles set out in this Directive. Such a model or approach could include choosing market-based or regulatory principles which provide solutions to comply with this Directive, such as models where imbalances are settled or where perimeter corrections are introduced. The chosen model should contain transparent and fair rules to allow independent aggregators to fulfil their roles as intermediaries and to ensure that the final customer adequately benefits from their activities. Products should be defined on all electricity markets, including ancillary services and capacity markets, so as to encourage the participation of demand response. (40) The Commission Communication of 20 July 2016, entitled European Strategy for Low-Emission Mobility, stresses the need for the decarbonisation of the transport sector and the reduction of its emissions, especially in urban areas, and highlights the important role that electromobility can play in contributing to those objectives. Moreover, the deployment of electromobility constitutes an important element of the energy transition. Market rules set out in this Directive should therefore contribute to creating favourable conditions for electric vehicles of all kinds. In particular, they should ensure the effective deployment of publicly accessible and private recharging points for electric vehicles and should ensure the efficient integration of vehicle charging into the system. (41) Demand response is pivotal to enabling the smart charging of electric vehicles and thereby enabling the efficient integration of electric vehicles into the electricity grid which will be crucial for the process of decarbonising transport. (42) Consumers should be able to consume, to store and to sell self-generated electricity to the market and to participate in all electricity markets by providing flexibility to the system, for instance through energy storage, such as storage using electric vehicles, through demand response or through energy efficiency schemes. New technology developments will facilitate those activities in the future. However, legal and commercial barriers exist, including, for example, disproportionate fees for internally consumed electricity, obligations to feed self-generated electricity to the energy system, and administrative burdens, such as the need for consumers who self-generate electricity and sell it to the system to comply with the requirements for suppliers, etc. Such obstacles, which prevent consumers from self-generating electricity and from consuming, storing or selling self-generated electricity to the market, should be removed while it should be ensured that such consumers contribute adequately to system costs. Member States should be able to have different provisions in their national law with respect to taxes and levies for individual and jointly-acting active customers, as well as for household and other final customers. (43) Distributed energy technologies and consumer empowerment have made community energy an effective and cost-efficient way to meet citizens' needs and expectations regarding energy sources, services and local participation. Community energy offers an inclusive option for all consumers to have a direct stake in producing, consuming or sharing energy. Community energy initiatives focus primarily on providing affordable energy of a specific kind, such as renewable energy, for their members or shareholders rather than on prioritising profit-making like a traditional electricity undertaking. By directly engaging with consumers, community energy initiatives demonstrate their potential to facilitate the uptake of new technologies and consumption patterns, including smart distribution grids and demand response, in an integrated manner. Community energy can also advance energy efficiency at household level and help fight energy poverty through reduced consumption and lower supply tariffs. Community energy also enables certain groups of household customers to participate in the electricity markets, who otherwise might not have been able to do so. Where they have been successfully operated such initiatives have delivered economic, social and environmental benefits to the community that go beyond the mere benefits derived from the provision of energy services. This Directive aims to recognise certain categories of citizen energy initiatives at the Union level as citizen energy communities, in order to provide them with an enabling framework, fair treatment, a level playing field and a well-defined catalogue of rights and obligations. Household customers should be allowed to participate voluntarily in community energy initiatives as well as to leave them, without losing access to the network operated by the community energy initiative or losing their rights as consumers. Access to a citizen energy community's network should be granted on fair and cost-reflective terms. (44) Membership of citizen energy communities should be open to all categories of entities. However, the decision-making powers within a citizen energy community should be limited to those members or shareholders that are not engaged in large-scale commercial activity and for which the energy sector does not constitute a primary area of economic activity. Citizen energy communities are considered to be a category of cooperation of citizens or local actors that should be subject to recognition and protection under Union law. The provisions on citizen energy communities do not preclude the existence of other citizen initiatives such as those stemming from private law agreements. It should therefore be possible for Member States to provide that citizen energy communities take any form of entity, for example that of an association, a cooperative, a partnership, a non-profit organisation or a small or medium-sized enterprise, provided that the entity is entitled to exercise rights and be subject to obligations in its own name. (45) The provisions of this Directive on citizen energy communities provide for rights and obligations, which are possible to deduce from other, existing rights and obligations, such as the freedom of contract, the right to switch supplier, the responsibilities of the distribution system operator, the rules on network charges, and balancing obligations. (46) Citizen energy communities constitute a new type of entity due to their membership structure, governance requirements and purpose. They should be allowed to operate on the market on a level playing field without distorting competition, and the rights and obligations applicable to the other electricity undertakings on the market should be applied to citizen energy communities in a non-discriminatory and proportionate manner. Those rights and obligations should apply in accordance with the roles that they undertake, such as the roles of final customers, producers, suppliers or distribution system operators. Citizen energy communities should not face regulatory restrictions when they apply existing or future information and communications technologies to share electricity produced using generation assets within the citizen energy community among their members or shareholders based on market principles, for example by offsetting the energy component of members or shareholders using the generation available within the community, even over the public network, provided that both metering points belong to the community. Electricity sharing enables members or shareholders to be supplied with electricity from generating installations within the community without being in direct physical proximity to the generating installation and without being behind a single metering point. Where electricity is shared, the sharing should not affect the collection of network charges, tariffs and levies related to electricity flows. The sharing should be facilitated in accordance with the obligations and correct timeframes for balancing, metering and settlement. The provisions of this Directive on citizen energy communities do not interfere with the competence of Member States to design and implement policies relating to the energy sector in relation to network charges and tariffs, or to design and implement energy policy financing systems and cost sharing, provided that those policies are non-discriminatory and lawful. (47) This Directive empowers Member States to allow citizen energy communities to become distribution system operators either under the general regime or as closed distribution system operators. Once a citizen energy community is granted the status of a distribution system operator, it should be treated as, and be subject to the same obligations as, a distribution system operator. The provisions of this Directive on citizen energy communities only clarify aspects of distribution system operation that are likely to be relevant for citizen energy communities, while other aspects of distribution system operation apply in accordance with the rules relating to distribution system operators. (48) Electricity bills are an important means by which final customers are informed. As well as providing data on consumption and costs, they can also convey other information that helps consumers to compare their current arrangements with other offers. However, disputes over bills are a very common source of consumer complaints, a factor which contributes to the persistently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement in the electricity sector. It is therefore necessary to make bills clearer and easier to understand, as well as to ensure that bills and billing information prominently display a limited number of important items of information that are necessary to enable consumers to regulate their energy consumption, compare offers and switch supplier. Other items of information should be made available to final customers in, with or signposted to within their bills. Such items should be displayed on the bill or be in a separate document attached to the bill, or the bill should contain a reference to where the final customer is easily able to find the information on a website, through a mobile application or by other means. (49) The regular provision of accurate billing information based on actual electricity consumption, facilitated by smart metering, is important for helping customers to control their electricity consumption and costs. Nevertheless, customers, in particular household customers, should have access to flexible arrangements for the actual payment of their bills. For example, it could be possible for customers to be provided with frequent billing information, while paying only on a quarterly basis, or there could be products for which the customer pays the same amount every month, independently of the actual consumption. (50) The provisions on billing in Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) should be updated, streamlined and moved to this Directive, where they fit more coherently. (51) Member States should encourage the modernisation of distribution networks, such as through the introduction of smart grids, which should be built in a way that encourages decentralised generation and energy efficiency. (52) Engaging consumers requires appropriate incentives and technologies such as smart metering systems. Smart metering systems empower consumers because they allow them to receive accurate and near real-time feedback on their energy consumption or generation, and to manage their consumption better, to participate in and reap benefits from demand response programmes and other services, and to lower their electricity bills. Smart metering systems also enable distribution system operators to have better visibility of their networks, and as a consequence, to reduce their operation and maintenance costs and to pass those savings on to the consumers in the form of lower distribution tariffs. (53) When it comes to deciding at national level on the deployment of smart metering systems, it should be possible to base this decision on an economic assessment. That economic assessment should take into account the long-term benefits of the deployment of smart metering systems to consumers and the whole value chain, such as better network management, more precise planning and identification of network losses. Should that assessment conclude that the introduction of such metering systems is cost-effective only for consumers with a certain amount of electricity consumption, Member States should be able to take that conclusion into account when proceeding with the deployment of smart metering systems. However, such assessments should be reviewed regularly in response to significant changes in the underlying assumptions, or at least every four years, given the fast pace of technological developments. (54) Member States that do not systematically deploy smart metering systems should allow consumers to benefit from the installation of a smart meter, upon request and under fair and reasonable conditions, and should provide them with all the relevant information. Where consumers do not have smart meters, they should be entitled to meters that fulfil the minimum requirements necessary to provide them with the billing information specified in this Directive. (55) In order to assist consumers' active participation in the electricity markets, the smart metering systems to be deployed by Member States in their territory should be interoperable, and should be able to provide data required for consumer energy management systems. To that end, Member States should have due regard to the use of relevant available standards, including standards that enable interoperability on the level of the data model and the application layer, to best practices and the importance of the development of data exchange, to future and innovative energy services, to the deployment of smart grids and to the internal market for electricity. Moreover, the smart metering systems that are deployed should not represent a barrier to switching supplier, and should be equipped with fit-for-purpose functionalities that allow consumers to have near real-time access to their consumption data, to modulate their energy consumption and, to the extent that the supporting infrastructure permits, to offer their flexibility to the network and to electricity undertakings and to be rewarded for it, and to obtain savings in their electricity bills. (56) A key aspect of supplying customers is providing access to objective and transparent consumption data. Thus, consumers should have access to their consumption data and to the prices and service costs associated with their consumption, so that they can invite competitors to make offers based on that information. Consumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy consumption. Prepayments should not place a disproportionate disadvantage on their users, while different payment systems should be non-discriminatory. The information on energy costs that is provided to consumers sufficiently frequently would create incentives for energy savings because it would give customers direct feedback on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and on changes of behaviour. In that respect, the full implementation of Directive 2012/27/EU will help consumers to reduce their energy costs. (57) Currently, different models for the management of data have been developed or are under development in Member States following deployment of smart metering systems. Independently of the data management model it is important that Member States put in place transparent rules under which data can be accessed under non-discriminatory conditions and ensure the highest level of cybersecurity and data protection as well as the impartiality of the entities which process data. (58) Member States should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable and energy poor customers in the context of the internal market for electricity. Such measures may differ according to the particular circumstances in the Member States in question and may include social or energy policy measures relating to the payment of electricity bills, to investment in the energy efficiency of residential buildings, or to consumer protection such as disconnection safeguards. Where universal service is also provided to small enterprises, measures to ensure universal service provision may differ according to whether those measures are aimed at household customers or small enterprises. (59) Energy services are fundamental to safeguarding the well-being of the Union citizens. Adequate warmth, cooling and lighting, and energy to power appliances are essential services to guarantee a decent standard of living and citizens' health. Furthermore, access to those energy services enables Union citizens to fulfil their potential and enhances social inclusion. Energy poor households are unable to afford those energy services due to a combination of low income, high expenditure on energy and poor energy efficiency of their homes. Member States should collect the right information to monitor the number of households in energy poverty. Accurate measurement should assist Member States in identifying households that are affected by energy poverty in order to provide targeted support. The Commission should actively support the implementation of the provisions of this Directive on energy poverty by facilitating the sharing of good practices between Member States. (60) Where Member States are affected by energy poverty and have not developed national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to tackle energy poverty, they should do so, with the aim of decreasing the number of energy poor customers. Low income, high expenditure on energy, and poor energy efficiency of homes are relevant factors in establishing criteria for the measurement of energy poverty. In any event, Member States should ensure the necessary supply for vulnerable and energy poor customers. In doing so, an integrated approach, such as in the framework of energy and social policy, could be used and measures could include social policies or energy efficiency improvements for housing. This Directive should enhance national policies in favour of vulnerable and energy poor customers. (61) Distribution system operators have to cost-efficiently integrate new electricity generation, especially installations generating electricity from renewable sources, and new loads such as loads that result from heat pumps and electric vehicles. For that purpose, distribution system operators should be enabled, and provided with incentives, to use services from distributed energy resources such as demand response and energy storage, based on market procedures, in order to efficiently operate their networks and to avoid costly network expansions. Member States should put in place appropriate measures such as national network codes and market rules, and should provide incentives to distribution system operators through network tariffs which do not create obstacles to flexibility or to the improvement of energy efficiency in the grid. Member States should also introduce network development plans for distribution systems in order to support the integration of installations generating electricity from renewable energy sources, facilitate the development of energy storage facilities and the electrification of the transport sector, and provide to system users adequate information regarding the anticipated expansions or upgrades of the network, as currently such procedures do not exist in the majority of Member States. (62) System operators should not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities. In the new electricity market design, energy storage services should be market-based and competitive. Consequently, cross-subsidisation between energy storage and the regulated functions of distribution or transmission should be avoided. Such restrictions on the ownership of energy storage facilities is to prevent distortion of competition, to eliminate the risk of discrimination, to ensure fair access to energy storage services to all market participants and to foster the effective and efficient use of energy storage facilities, beyond the operation of the distribution or transmission system. That requirement should be interpreted and applied in accordance with the rights and principles established under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), in particular the freedom to conduct a business and the right to property guaranteed by Articles 16 and 17 of the Charter. (63) Where energy storage facilities are fully integrated network components that are not used for balancing or for congestion management, they should not, subject to approval by the regulatory authority, be required to comply with the same strict limitations for system operators to own, develop, manage or operate those facilities. Such fully integrated network components can include energy storage facilities such as capacitors or flywheels which provide important services for network security and reliability, and contribute to the synchronisation of different parts of the system. (64) With the objective of progress towards a completely decarbonised electricity sector that is fully free of emissions, it is necessary to make progress in seasonal energy storage. Such energy storage is an element that would serve as a tool for the operation of the electricity system to allow for short-term and seasonal adjustment, in order to cope with variability in the production of electricity from renewable sources and the associated contingencies in those horizons. (65) Non-discriminatory access to the distribution network determines downstream access to customers at retail level. To create a level playing field at retail level, the activities of distribution system operators should therefore be monitored so that distribution system operators are prevented from taking advantage of their vertical integration as regards their competitive position on the market, in particular in relation to household customers and small non-household customers. (66) Where a closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated supply that requires specific operational standards, or where a closed distribution system is maintained primarily for the use of the owner of the system, it should be possible to exempt the distribution system operator from obligations which would constitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship between the distribution system operator and the system users. Industrial sites, commercial sites or shared services sites such as train station buildings, airports, hospitals, large camping sites with integrated facilities, and chemical industry sites can include closed distribution systems because of the specialised nature of their operations. (67) Without the effective separation of networks from activities of generation and supply (effective unbundling), there is an inherent risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the network but also in the incentives for vertically integrated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks. (68) Only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discriminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effective unbundling. Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and production interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure security of supply. For that reason, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 10 July 2007 on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market, referred to ownership unbundling at transmission level as the most effective tool for promoting investments in infrastructure in a non-discriminatory way, fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market. Under ownership unbundling, Member States should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over a producer or supplier and, at the same time, exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator or transmission system. Conversely, control over a transmission system operator or transmission system should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over a producer or supplier. Within those limits, a producer or supplier should be able to have a minority shareholding in a transmission system operator or transmission system. (69) Any system for unbundling should be effective in removing any conflict of interests between producers, suppliers and transmission system operators, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and to guarantee the access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for regulatory authorities. (70) Since ownership unbundling requires the restructuring of undertakings in some instances, Member States that decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provisions. In view of the vertical links between the electricity and gas sectors, the unbundling provisions should apply across the two sectors. (71) Under ownership unbundling, to ensure full independence of network operation from supply and generation interests, and to prevent exchanges of any confidential information, the same person should not be a member of the managing board of both a transmission system operator or a transmission system and an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply. For the same reason, the same person should not be entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of a transmission system operator or a transmission system and to exercise control or any right over a producer or supplier. (72) The setting up of a system operator or transmission operator that is independent from supply and generation interests should enable a vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets while ensuring the effective separation of interests, provided that such independent system operator or independent transmission operator performs all of the functions of a system operator, and provided that detailed regulation and extensive regulatory control mechanisms are put in place. (73) Where, on 3 September 2009, an undertaking owning a transmission system was part of a vertically integrated undertaking, Member States should be given a choice between ownership unbundling and setting up a system operator or transmission operator which is independent from supply and generation interests. (74) To preserve fully the interests of the shareholders of vertically integrated undertakings, Member States should have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestments or by splitting the shares of the integrated undertaking into shares of a network undertaking and shares of a remaining supply and generation undertaking, provided that the requirements resulting from ownership unbundling are complied with. (75) The full effectiveness of the independent system operator or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules. The rules on independent transmission operators provide an appropriate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition, sufficient investment, access for new market entrants and integration of electricity markets. Effective unbundling through provisions on independent transmission operators should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmission system operators and on a pillar of measures relating to investment, to connecting new production capacities to the network and to market integration through regional cooperation. The independence of transmission operators should also be ensured, inter alia, through certain cooling-off periods during which no management or other relevant activity giving access to the same information that could have been obtained in a managerial position is exercised in the vertically integrated undertaking. (76) Member States have the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in their territory. Where a Member State has exercised that right, an undertaking does not have the right to set up an independent system operator or an independent transmission operator. Furthermore, an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over a transmission system operator from a Member State that has opted for full ownership unbundling. (77) The implementation of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non-discrimination between the public and private sectors. To that end, the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right, in violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or the independent system operator option, solely or jointly, over the composition, voting or decisions of both the bodies of the transmission system operators or the transmission systems and the bodies of the producer or supplier. With regard to ownership unbundling and the independent system operator solution, provided that the relevant Member State is able to demonstrate that the relevant requirements have been complied with, two separate public bodies should be able to control generation and supply activities, on the one hand, and transmission activities, on the other. (78) Fully effective separation of network activities from supply and generation activities should apply throughout the Union to both Union and non-Union undertakings. To ensure that network activities and supply and generation activities throughout the Union remain independent from each other, regulatory authorities should be empowered to refuse to certify transmission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules. To ensure the consistent application of those rules across the Union, the regulatory authorities should take the utmost account of Commission opinions when they take decisions on certification. In addition, to ensure respect for the international obligations of the Union, and to ensure solidarity and energy security within the Union, the Commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to a transmission system owner or a transmission system operator which is controlled by a person or persons from a third country or third countries. (79) Authorisation procedures should not lead to administrative burdens that are disproportionate to the size and potential impact of the producers. Unduly lengthy authorisation procedures may constitute a barrier to access for new market entrants. (80) Regulatory authorities need to be able to take decisions in relation to all relevant regulatory issues if the internal market for electricity is to function properly, and need to be fully independent from any other public or private interests. This precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentary supervision in accordance with the constitutional laws of the Member States. In addition, the approval of the budget of the regulatory authority by the national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonomy. The provisions relating to the autonomy in the implementation of the allocated budget of the regulatory authority should be implemented in the framework defined by national budgetary law and rules. While contributing to the regulatory authorities' independence from any political or economic interest through an appropriate rotation scheme, it should be possible for Member States to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the board. (81) Regulatory authorities should be able to fix or approve tariffs, or the methodologies underlying the calculation of the tariffs, on the basis of a proposal by the transmission system operator or distribution system operators, or on the basis of a proposal agreed between those operators and the users of the network. In carrying out those tasks, regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission and distribution tariffs are non-discriminatory and cost-reflective, and should take account of the long-term, marginal, avoided network costs from distributed generation and demand-side management measures. (82) Regulatory authorities should fix or approve individual grid tariffs for transmission and distribution networks or a methodology, or both. In either case, the independence of the regulatory authorities in setting network tariffs pursuant to point (b)(ii) of Article 57(4) should be preserved. (83) Regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission system operators and distribution system operators take appropriate measures to make their network more resilient and flexible. To that end, they should monitor those operators' performance based on indicators such as the capability of transmission system operators and distribution system operators to operate lines under dynamic line rating, the development of remote monitoring and real-time control of substations, the reduction of grid losses and the frequency and duration of power interruptions. (84) Regulatory authorities should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electricity undertakings and to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that a competent court impose such penalties on them. To that end, regulatory authorities should be able to request relevant information from electricity undertakings, to conduct appropriate and sufficient investigations, and to settle disputes. Regulatory authorities should also be granted the power to decide, irrespective of the application of competition rules, on appropriate measures that ensure customer benefits through the promotion of effective competition necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity. (85) Regulatory authorities should coordinate among themselves when carrying out their tasks to ensure that the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (the ENTSO for Electricity), the European Entity for Distribution System Operators (the EU DSO entity), and the regional coordination centres comply with their obligations under the regulatory framework of the internal market for electricity, and with decisions of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), established by Regulation (EU) 2019/942 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). With the expansion of the operational responsibilities of the ENTSO for Electricity, the EU DSO entity and the regional coordination centres, it is necessary to enhance oversight with regard to entities that operate at Union or regional level. Regulatory authorities should consult each other and should coordinate their oversight to jointly identify situations where the ENTSO for Electricity, the EU DSO entity or the regional coordination centres do not comply with their respective obligations. (86) Regulatory authorities should also be granted the power to contribute to ensuring high standards of universal and public service obligations in accordance with market opening, to the protection of vulnerable customers, and to the full effectiveness of consumer protection measures. Those provisions should be without prejudice to both the Commission's powers concerning the application of competition rules, including the examination of mergers with a Union dimension, and the rules on the internal market, such as the rules on the free movement of capital. The independent body to which a party affected by the decision of a regulatory authority has a right to appeal could be a court or another tribunal that is empowered to conduct a judicial review. (87) This Directive and Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) do not deprive Member States of the possibility of establishing and issuing their national energy policy. It follows that, depending on a Member State's constitutional arrangements, it might be within Member State's competence to determine the policy framework in which the regulatory authorities are to operate, for example concerning security of supply. However, the general energy policy guidelines issued by the Member State should not impinge on the independence or autonomy of the regulatory authorities. (88) Regulation (EU) 2019/943 provides for the Commission to adopt guidelines or network codes to achieve the necessary degree of harmonisation. Such guidelines and network codes constitute binding implementing measures and, with regard to certain provisions of this Directive, are a useful tool that can be adapted quickly where necessary. (89) Member States and the Contracting Parties to the Treaty establishing the Energy Community (11) should cooperate closely on all matters concerning the development of an integrated electricity trading region and should take no measures that endanger the further integration of electricity markets or the security of supply of Member States and Contracting Parties. (90) This Directive should be read together with Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which lays down the key principles of the new market design for electricity which will enable better rewards for flexibility, provide adequate price signals, and ensure the development of functioning integrated short-term markets. Regulation (EU) 2019/943 also sets out new rules in various areas, including on capacity mechanisms and cooperation between transmission system operators. (91) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter. Accordingly, this Directive should be interpreted and applied in accordance with those rights and principles, in particular the right to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Article 8 of the Charter. It is essential that any processing of personal data under this Directive comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). (92) In order to provide the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to establish rules on the extent of the duties of the regulatory authorities to cooperate with each other and with ACER and setting out the details of the procedure for compliance with the network codes and guidelines. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (13). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of the delegated acts. (93) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to determine interoperability requirements and non-discriminatory and transparent procedures for access to metering data, consumption data, as well as data required for customer switching, demand response and other services. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14). (94) Where a derogation applies pursuant to Article 66(3), (4) or (5), that derogation should also cover any provisions in this Directive that are ancillary to, or that require the prior application of, any of the provisions from which it has been granted a derogation. (95) The provisions of Directive 2012/27/EU related to electricity markets, such as the provisions on metering and billing of electricity, demand response, priority dispatch and grid access for high-efficiency cogeneration, are updated by the provisions laid down in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) 2019/943. Directive 2012/27/EU should therefore be amended accordingly. (96) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the creation of a fully operational internal market for electricity, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by the reasons of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (97) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (15), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. (98) The obligation to transpose this Directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent a substantive amendment as compared to Directive 2009/72/EC. The obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under Directive 2009/72/EC. (99) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for the transposition into national law and the date of application of Directive 2009/72/EC set out in Annex III, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I SUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS Article 1 Subject matter This Directive establishes common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution, energy storage and supply of electricity, together with consumer protection provisions, with a view to creating truly integrated competitive, consumer-centred, flexible, fair and transparent electricity markets in the Union.

CHAPTER II GENERAL RULES FOR THE ORGANISATION OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR Article 3 Competitive, consumer-centred, flexible and non-discriminatory electricity markets 1. Member States shall ensure that their national law does not unduly hamper cross-border trade in electricity, consumer participation, including through demand response, investments into, in particular, variable and flexible energy generation, energy storage, or the deployment of electromobility or new interconnectors between Member States, and shall ensure that electricity prices reflect actual demand and supply. 2. When developing new interconnectors, Member States shall take into account the electricity interconnection targets set out in point (1) of Article 4(d) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999. 3. Member States shall ensure that no undue barriers exist within the internal market for electricity as regards market entry, operation and exit, without prejudice to the competence that Member States retain in relation to third countries. 4. Member States shall ensure a level playing field where electricity undertakings are subject to transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory rules, fees and treatment, in particular with respect to balancing responsibility, access to wholesale markets, access to data, switching processes and billing regimes and, where applicable, licensing. 5. Member States shall ensure that market participants from third countries, when operating within the internal market for electricity, comply with applicable Union and national law, including that concerning environmental and safety policy. Article 4 Free choice of supplier Member States shall ensure that all customers are free to purchase electricity from the supplier of their choice and shall ensure that all customers are free to have more than one electricity supply contract at the same time, provided that the required connection and metering points are established. Article 5 Market-based supply prices 1. Suppliers shall be free to determine the price at which they supply electricity to customers. Member States shall take appropriate actions to ensure effective competition between suppliers. 2. Member States shall ensure the protection of energy poor and vulnerable household customers pursuant to Articles 28 and 29 by social policy or by other means than public interventions in the price setting for the supply of electricity. 3. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, Member States may apply public interventions in the price setting for the supply of electricity to energy poor or vulnerable household customers. Such public interventions shall be subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 4 and 5. 4. Public interventions in the price setting for the supply of electricity shall: (a) pursue a general economic interest and not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that general economic interest; (b) be clearly defined, transparent, non-discriminatory and verifiable; (c) guarantee equal access for Union electricity undertakings to customers; (d) be limited in time and proportionate as regards their beneficiaries; (e) not result in additional costs for market participants in a discriminatory way. 5. Any Member State applying public interventions in the price setting for the supply of electricity in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article shall also comply with point (d) of Article 3(3) and with Article 24 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, regardless of whether the Member State concerned has a significant number of households in energy poverty. 6. For the purpose of a transition period to establish effective competition for electricity supply contracts between suppliers, and to achieve fully effective market-based retail pricing of electricity in accordance with paragraph 1, Member States may apply public interventions in the price setting for the supply of electricity to household customers and to microenterprises that do not benefit from public interventions pursuant to paragraph 3. 7. Public interventions pursuant to paragraph 6 shall comply with the criteria set out in paragraph 4 and shall: (a) be accompanied by a set of measures to achieve effective competition and a methodology for assessing progress with regard to those measures; (b) be set using a methodology that ensures non-discriminatory treatment of suppliers; (c) be set at a price that is above cost, at a level where effective price competition can occur; (d) be designed to minimise any negative impact on the wholesale electricity market; (e) ensure that all beneficiaries of such public interventions have the possibility to choose competitive market offers and are directly informed at least every quarter of the availability of offers and savings in the competitive market, in particular of dynamic electricity price contracts, and shall ensure that they are provided with assistance to switch to a market-based offer; (f) ensure that, pursuant to Articles 19 and 21, all beneficiaries of such public interventions are entitled to, and are offered to, have smart meters installed at no extra upfront cost to the customer, are directly informed of the possibility of installing smart meters and are provided with necessary assistance; (g) not lead to direct cross-subsidisation between customers supplied at free market prices and those supplied at regulated supply prices. 8. Member States shall notify the measures taken in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 6 to the Commission within one month after their adoption and may apply them immediately. The notification shall be accompanied by an explanation of why other instruments were not sufficient to achieve the objective pursued, of how the requirements set out in paragraphs 4 and 7 are fulfilled and of the effects of the notified measures on competition. The notification shall describe the scope of the beneficiaries, the duration of the measures and the number of household customers affected by the measures, and shall explain how the regulated prices have been determined. 9. By 1 January 2022 and 1 January 2025, Member States shall submit reports to the Commission on the implementation of this Article, the necessity and proportionality of public interventions under this Article, and an assessment of the progress towards achieving effective competition between suppliers and the transition to market-based prices. Member States that apply regulated prices in accordance with paragraph 6 shall report on the compliance with the conditions set out in paragraph 7, including on compliance by suppliers that are required to apply such interventions, as well as on the impact of regulated prices on the finances of those suppliers. 10. By 31 December 2025, the Commission shall review and submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Article for the purpose of achieving market-based retail pricing of electricity, together with or followed by a legislative proposal, if appropriate. That legislative proposal may include an end date for regulated prices. Article 6 Third-party access 1. Member States shall ensure the implementation of a system of third-party access to the transmission and distribution systems based on published tariffs, applicable to all customers and applied objectively and without discrimination between system users. Member States shall ensure that those tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calculation, are approved in accordance with Article 59 prior to their entry into force and that those tariffs, and the methodologies  where only methodologies are approved  are published prior to their entry into force. 2. The transmission or distribution system operator may refuse access where it lacks the necessary capacity. Duly substantiated reasons shall be given for such refusal, in particular having regard to Article 9, and based on objective and technically and economically justified criteria. Member States or, where Member States have so provided, the regulatory authorities of those Member States, shall ensure that those criteria are consistently applied and that the system user who has been refused access can make use of a dispute settlement procedure. The regulatory authorities shall also ensure, where appropriate and when refusal of access takes place, that the transmission system operator or distribution system operator provides relevant information on measures that would be necessary to reinforce the network. Such information shall be provided in all cases when access for recharging points has been denied. The party requesting such information may be charged a reasonable fee reflecting the cost of providing such information. 3. This Article shall also apply to citizen energy communities that manage distribution networks. Article 7 Direct lines 1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to enable: (a) all producers and electricity supply undertakings established within their territory to supply their own premises, subsidiaries and customers through a direct line, without being subject to disproportionate administrative procedures or costs; (b) all customers within their territory, individually or jointly, to be supplied through a direct line by producers and electricity supply undertakings. 2. Member States shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction of direct lines in their territory. Those criteria shall be objective and non-discriminatory. 3. The possibility of supplying electricity through a direct line as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not affect the possibility of contracting electricity in accordance with Article 6. 4. Member States may issue authorisations to construct a direct line, subject either to the refusal of system access on the basis, as appropriate, of Article 6 or to the opening of a dispute settlement procedure under Article 60. 5. Member States may refuse to authorise a direct line if the granting of such an authorisation would obstruct the application of the provisions on public service obligations in Article 9. Duly substantiated reasons shall be given for such a refusal. Article 8 Authorisation procedure for new capacity 1. For the construction of new generating capacity, Member States shall adopt an authorisation procedure, which shall be conducted in accordance with objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. 2. Member States shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations for the construction of generating capacity in their territory. In determining appropriate criteria, Member States shall consider: (a) the safety and security of the electricity system, installations and associated equipment; (b) the protection of public health and safety; (c) the protection of the environment; (d) land use and siting; (e) the use of public ground; (f) energy efficiency; (g) the nature of the primary sources; (h) the characteristics particular to the applicant, such as technical, economic and financial capabilities; (i) compliance with measures adopted pursuant to Article 9; (j) the contribution of generating capacity to meeting the overall Union target of at least a 32 % share of energy from renewable sources in the Union's gross final consumption of energy in 2030 referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19); (k) the contribution of generating capacity to reducing emissions; and (l) the alternatives to the construction of new generating capacity, such as demand response solutions and energy storage. 3. Member States shall ensure that specific, simplified and streamlined authorisation procedures exist for small decentralised and/or distributed generation, which take into account their limited size and potential impact. Member States may set guidelines for that specific authorisation procedure. Regulatory authorities or other competent national authorities, including planning authorities, shall review those guidelines and may recommend amendments thereto. Where Member States have established particular land use permit procedures applying to major new infrastructure projects in generation capacity, Member States shall, where appropriate, include the construction of new generation capacity within the scope of those procedures and shall implement them in a non-discriminatory manner and within an appropriate time frame. 4. The authorisation procedures and criteria shall be made public. Applicants shall be informed of the reasons for any refusal to grant an authorisation. Those reasons shall be objective, non-discriminatory, well-founded and duly substantiated. Appeal procedures shall be made available to applicants. Article 9 Public service obligations 1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, Member States shall ensure, on the basis of their institutional organisation and with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity, that electricity undertakings operate in accordance with the principles of this Directive with a view to achieving a competitive, secure and environmentally sustainable market for electricity, and shall not discriminate between those undertakings as regards either rights or obligations. 2. Having full regard to the relevant provisions of the TFEU, in particular Article 106 thereof, Member States may impose on undertakings operating in the electricity sector, in the general economic interest, public service obligations which may relate to security, including the security of supply, regularity, quality and price of supplies and environmental protection, including energy efficiency, energy from renewable sources and climate protection. Such obligations shall be clearly defined, transparent, non-discriminatory and verifiable, and shall guarantee equality of access for electricity undertakings of the Union to national consumers. Public service obligations which concern the price setting for the supply of electricity shall comply with the requirements set out in Article 5 of this Directive. 3. Where financial compensation, other forms of compensation and exclusive rights which a Member State grants for the fulfilment of the obligations set out in paragraph 2 of this Article or for the provision of universal service as set out in Article 27 are provided, this shall be done in a non-discriminatory and transparent way. 4. Member States shall, upon implementation of this Directive, inform the Commission of all measures adopted to fulfil universal service and public service obligations, including consumer protection and environmental protection, and their possible effect on national and international competition, whether or not such measures require a derogation from this Directive. They shall subsequently inform the Commission every two years of any changes to those measures, whether or not they require a derogation from this Directive. 5. Member States may decide not to apply Articles 6, 7 and 8 of this Directive insofar as their application would obstruct, in law or in fact, the performance of the obligations imposed on electricity undertakings in the general economic interest and insofar as the development of trade would not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Union. The interests of the Union include, inter alia, competition with regard to customers in accordance with Article 106 TFEU and this Directive. CHAPTER III CONSUMER EMPOWERMENT AND PROTECTION Article 10 Basic contractual rights 1. Member States shall ensure that all final customers are entitled to have their electricity provided by a supplier, subject to the supplier's agreement, regardless of the Member State in which the supplier is registered, provided that the supplier follows the applicable trading and balancing rules. In that regard, Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that administrative procedures do not discriminate against suppliers already registered in another Member State. 2. Without prejudice to Union rules on consumer protection, in particular Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (20) and Council Directive 93/13/EEC (21), Member States shall ensure that final customers have the rights provided for in paragraphs 3 to 12 of this Article. 3. Final customers shall have the right to a contract with their supplier that specifies: (a) the identity and address of the supplier; (b) the services provided, the service quality levels offered, as well as the time for the initial connection; (c) the types of maintenance service offered; (d) the means by which up-to-date information on all applicable tariffs, maintenance charges and bundled products or services may be obtained; (e) the duration of the contract, the conditions for renewal and termination of the contract and services, including products or services that are bundled with those services, and whether terminating the contract without charge is permitted; (f) any compensation and the refund arrangements which apply if contracted service quality levels are not met, including inaccurate or delayed billing; (g) the method of initiating an out-of-court dispute settlement procedure in accordance with Article 26; (h) information relating to consumer rights, including information on complaint handling and all of the information referred to in this paragraph, that is clearly communicated on the bill or the electricity undertaking's web site. Conditions shall be fair and well known in advance. In any case, this information shall be provided prior to the conclusion or confirmation of the contract. Where contracts are concluded through intermediaries, the information relating to the matters set out in this paragraph shall also be provided prior to the conclusion of the contract. Final customers shall be provided with a summary of the key contractual conditions in a prominent manner and in concise and simple language. 4. Final customers shall be given adequate notice of any intention to modify contractual conditions and shall be informed about their right to terminate the contract when the notice is given. Suppliers shall notify their final customers, in a transparent and comprehensible manner, directly of any adjustment in the supply price and of the reasons and preconditions for the adjustment and its scope, at an appropriate time no later than two weeks, or no later than one month in the case of household customers, before the adjustment comes into effect. Member States shall ensure that final customers are free to terminate contracts if they do not accept the new contractual conditions or adjustments in the supply price notified to them by their supplier. 5. Suppliers shall provide final customers with transparent information on applicable prices and tariffs and on standard terms and conditions, in respect of access to and use of electricity services. 6. Suppliers shall offer final customers a wide choice of payment methods. Such payment methods shall not unduly discriminate between customers. Any difference in charges related to payment methods or prepayment systems shall be objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate and shall not exceed the direct costs borne by the payee for the use of a specific payment method or a prepayment system, in line with Article 62 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22). 7. Pursuant to paragraph 6, household customers who have access to prepayment systems shall not be placed at a disadvantage by the prepayment systems. 8. Suppliers shall offer final customers fair and transparent general terms and conditions, which shall be provided in plain and unambiguous language and shall not include non-contractual barriers to the exercise of customers' rights, such as excessive contractual documentation. Customers shall be protected against unfair or misleading selling methods. 9. Final customers shall have the right to a good standard of service and complaint handling by their suppliers. Suppliers shall handle complaints in a simple, fair and prompt manner. 10. When accessing universal service under the provisions adopted by Member States pursuant to Article 27, final customers shall be informed about their rights regarding universal service. 11.

Where a distribution system operator is responsible for the procurement of products and services necessary for the efficient, reliable and secure operation of the distribution system, rules adopted by the distribution system operator for that purpose shall be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, and shall be developed in coordination with transmission system operators and other relevant market participants. The terms and conditions, including rules and tariffs, where applicable, for the provision of such products and services to distribution system operators shall be established in accordance with Article 59(7) in a non-discriminatory and cost-reflective way and shall be published. 7. In performing the tasks referred to in paragraph 6, the distribution system operator shall procure the non-frequency ancillary services needed for its system in accordance with transparent, non-discriminatory and market-based procedures, unless the regulatory authority has assessed that the market-based provision of non-frequency ancillary services is economically not efficient and has granted a derogation. The obligation to procure non-frequency ancillary services does not apply to fully integrated network components. 8. The procurement of the products and services referred to in paragraph 6 shall ensure the effective participation of all qualified market participants, including market participants offering energy from renewable sources, market participants engaged in demand response, operators of energy storage facilities and market participants engaged in aggregation, in particular by requiring regulatory authorities and distribution system operators in close cooperation with all market participants, as well as transmission system operators, to establish the technical requirements for participation in those markets on the basis of the technical characteristics of those markets and the capabilities of all market participants. 9. Distribution system operators shall cooperate with transmission system operators for the effective participation of market participants connected to their grid in retail, wholesale and balancing markets. Delivery of balancing services stemming from resources located in the distribution system shall be agreed with the relevant transmission system operator in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and Article 182 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 (24). 10. Member States or their designated competent authorities may allow distribution system operators to perform activities other than those provided for in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) 2019/943, where such activities are necessary for the distribution system operators to fulfil their obligations under this Directive or Regulation (EU) 2019/943, provided that the regulatory authority has assessed the necessity of such a derogation. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the right of the distribution system operators to own, develop, manage or operate networks other than electricity networks where the Member State or the designated competent authority has granted such a right. Article 32 Incentives for the use of flexibility in distribution networks 1. Member States shall provide the necessary regulatory framework to allow and provide incentives to distribution system operators to procure flexibility services, including congestion management in their areas, in order to improve efficiencies in the operation and development of the distribution system. In particular, the regulatory framework shall ensure that distribution system operators are able to procure such services from providers of distributed generation, demand response or energy storage and shall promote the uptake of energy efficiency measures, where such services cost-effectively alleviate the need to upgrade or replace electricity capacity and support the efficient and secure operation of the distribution system. Distribution system operators shall procure such services in accordance with transparent, non-discriminatory and market-based procedures unless the regulatory authorities have established that the procurement of such services is not economically efficient or that such procurement would lead to severe market distortions or to higher congestion. 2. Distribution system operators, subject to approval by the regulatory authority, or the regulatory authority itself, shall, in a transparent and participatory process that includes all relevant system users and transmission system operators, establish the specifications for the flexibility services procured and, where appropriate, standardised market products for such services at least at national level. The specifications shall ensure the effective and non-discriminatory participation of all market participants, including market participants offering energy from renewable sources, market participants engaged in demand response, operators of energy storage facilities and market participants engaged in aggregation. Distribution system operators shall exchange all necessary information and shall coordinate with transmission system operators in order to ensure the optimal utilisation of resources, to ensure the secure and efficient operation of the system and to facilitate market development. Distribution system operators shall be adequately remunerated for the procurement of such services to allow them to recover at least their reasonable corresponding costs, including the necessary information and communication technology expenses and infrastructure costs. 3. The development of a distribution system shall be based on a transparent network development plan that the distribution system operator shall publish at least every two years and shall submit to the regulatory authority. The network development plan shall provide transparency on the medium and long-term flexibility services needed, and shall set out the planned investments for the next five-to-ten years, with particular emphasis on the main distribution infrastructure which is required in order to connect new generation capacity and new loads, including recharging points for electric vehicles. The network development plan shall also include the use of demand response, energy efficiency, energy storage facilities or other resources that the distribution system operator is to use as an alternative to system expansion. 4. The distribution system operator shall consult all relevant system users and the relevant transmission system operators on the network development plan. The distribution system operator shall publish the results of the consultation process along with the network development plan, and submit the results of the consultation and the network development plan to the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority may request amendments to the plan. 5. Member States may decide not to apply the obligation set out in paragraph 3 to integrated electricity undertakings which serve less than 100 000 connected customers or which serve small isolated systems. Article 33 Integration of electromobility into the electricity network 1. Without prejudice to Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (25), Member States shall provide the necessary regulatory framework to facilitate the connection of publicly accessible and private recharging points to the distribution networks. Member States shall ensure that distribution system operators cooperate on a non-discriminatory basis with any undertaking that owns, develops, operates or manages recharging points for electric vehicles, including with regard to connection to the grid. 2. Distribution system operators shall not own, develop, manage or operate recharging points for electric vehicles, except where distribution system operators own private recharging points solely for their own use. 3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, Member States may allow distribution system operators to own, develop, manage or operate recharging points for electric vehicles, provided that all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) other parties, following an open, transparent and non-discriminatory tendering procedure that is subject to review and approval by the regulatory authority, have not been awarded a right to own, develop, manage or operate recharging points for electric vehicles, or could not deliver those services at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner; (b) the regulatory authority has carried out an ex ante review of the conditions of the tendering procedure under point (a) and has granted its approval; (c) the distribution system operator operates the recharging points on the basis of third-party access in accordance with Article 6 and does not discriminate between system users or classes of system users, and in particular in favour of its related undertakings. The regulatory authority may draw up guidelines or procurement clauses to help distribution system operators ensure a fair tendering procedure. 4. Where Member States have implemented the conditions set out in paragraph 3, Member States or their designated competent authorities shall perform, at regular intervals or at least every five years, a public consultation in order to re-assess the potential interest of other parties in owning, developing, operating or managing recharging points for electric vehicles. Where the public consultation indicates that other parties are able to own, develop, operate or manage such points, Member States shall ensure that distribution system operators' activities in this regard are phased-out, subject to the successful completion of the tendering procedure referred to in point (a) of paragraph 3. As part of the conditions of that procedure, regulatory authorities may allow the distribution system operator to recover the residual value of its investment in recharging infrastructure. Article 34 Tasks of distribution system operators in data management Member States shall ensure that all eligible parties have non-discriminatory access to data under clear and equal terms, in accordance with the relevant data protection rules. In Member States where smart metering systems have been deployed in accordance with Article 19 and where distribution system operators are involved in data management, the compliance programmes referred to in point (d) of Article 35(2) shall include specific measures in order to exclude discriminatory access to data from eligible parties as provided for in Article 23. Where distribution system operators are not subject to Article 35(1), (2) or (3), Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that vertically integrated undertakings do not have privileged access to data for the conduct of their supply activities. Article 35 Unbundling of distribution system operators 1. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision-making from other activities not relating to distribution. Those rules shall not create an obligation to separate the ownership of assets of the distribution system operator from the vertically integrated undertaking. 2. In addition to the requirements under paragraph 1, where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, it shall be independent in terms of its organisation and decision-making from the other activities not related to distribution. In order to achieve this, the following minimum criteria shall apply: (a) the persons responsible for the management of the distribution system operator must not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity undertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, transmission or supply of electricity; (b) appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that the professional interests of the persons responsible for the management of the distribution system operator are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of acting independently; (c) the distribution system operator must have effective decision-making rights, independent from the integrated electricity undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the network. In order to fulfil those tasks, the distribution system operator shall have at its disposal the necessary resources including human, technical, physical and financial resources. This should not prevent the existence of appropriate coordination mechanisms to ensure that the economic and management supervision rights of the parent company in respect of return on assets, regulated indirectly in accordance with Article 59(7), in a subsidiary are protected. In particular, this shall enable the parent company to approve the annual financial plan, or any equivalent instrument, of the distribution system operator and to set global limits on the levels of indebtedness of its subsidiary. It shall not permit the parent company to give instructions regarding day-to-day operations, nor with respect to individual decisions concerning the construction or upgrading of distribution lines, that do not exceed the terms of the approved financial plan, or any equivalent instrument; and (d) the distribution system operator must establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that observance of it is adequately monitored. The compliance programme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet that objective. An annual report, setting out the measures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body responsible for monitoring the compliance programme, the compliance officer of the distribution system operator, to the regulatory authority referred to in Article 57(1) and shall be published. The compliance officer of the distribution system operator shall be fully independent and shall have access to all the necessary information of the distribution system operator and any affiliated undertaking to fulfil its task. 3. Where the distribution system operator is part of a vertically integrated undertaking, the Member States shall ensure that the activities of the distribution system operator are monitored by regulatory authorities or other competent bodies so that it cannot take advantage of its vertical integration to distort competition. In particular, vertically integrated distribution system operators shall not, in their communication and branding, create confusion with respect to the separate identity of the supply branch of the vertically integrated undertaking. 4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to integrated electricity undertakings which serve less than 100 000 connected customers, or serving small isolated systems. Article 36 Ownership of energy storage facilities by distribution system operators 1. Distribution system operators shall not own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities. 2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may allow distribution system operators to own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities, where they are fully integrated network components and the regulatory authority has granted its approval, or where all of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) other parties, following an open, transparent and non-discriminatory tendering procedure that is subject to review and approval by the regulatory authority, have not been awarded a right to own, develop, manage or operate such facilities, or could not deliver those services at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner; (b) such facilities are necessary for the distribution system operators to fulfil their obligations under this Directive for the efficient, reliable and secure operation of the distribution system and the facilities are not used to buy or sell electricity in the electricity markets; and (c) the regulatory authority has assessed the necessity of such a derogation and has carried out an assessment of the tendering procedure, including the conditions of the tendering procedure, and has granted its approval. The regulatory authority may draw up guidelines or procurement clauses to help distribution system operators ensure a fair tendering procedure. 3. The regulatory authorities shall perform, at regular intervals or at least every five years, a public consultation on the existing energy storage facilities in order to assess the potential availability and interest in investing in such facilities. Where the public consultation, as assessed by the regulatory authority, indicates that third parties are able to own, develop, operate or manage such facilities in a cost-effective manner, the regulatory authority shall ensure that the distribution system operators' activities in this regard are phased out within 18 months. As part of the conditions of that procedure, regulatory authorities may allow the distribution system operators to receive reasonable compensation, in particular to recover the residual value of their investment in the energy storage facilities. 4. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to fully integrated network components or for the usual depreciation period of new battery storage facilities with a final investment decision until 4 July 2019, provided that such battery storage facilities are: (a) connected to the grid at the latest two years thereafter; (b) integrated into the distribution system; (c) used only for the reactive instantaneous restoration of network security in the case of network contingencies where such restoration measure starts immediately and ends when regular re-dispatch can solve the issue; and (d) not used to buy or sell electricity in the electricity markets, including balancing. Article 37 Confidentiality obligation of distribution system operators Without prejudice to Article 55 or another legal requirement to disclose information, the distribution system operator shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its business, and shall prevent information about its own activities which may be commercially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. Article 38 Closed distribution systems 1. Member States may provide for regulatory authorities or other competent authorities to classify a system which distributes electricity within a geographically confined industrial, commercial or shared services site and does not, without prejudice to paragraph 4, supply household customers, as a closed distribution system if: (a) for specific technical or safety reasons, the operations or the production process of the users of that system are integrated; or (b) that system distributes electricity primarily to the owner or operator of the system or their related undertakings. 2. Closed distribution systems shall be considered to be distribution systems for the purposes of this Directive. Member States may provide for regulatory authorities to exempt the operator of a closed distribution system from: (a) the requirement under Article 31(5) and (7) to procure the energy it uses to cover energy losses and the non-frequency ancillary services in its system in accordance with transparent, non-discriminatory and market-based procedures; (b) the requirement under Article 6(1) that tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calculation, are approved in accordance with Article 59(1) prior to their entry into force; (c) the requirements under Article 32(1) to procure flexibility services and under Article 32(3) to develop the operator's system on the basis of network development plans; (d) the requirement under Article 33(2) not to own, develop, manage or operate recharging points for electric vehicles; and (e) the requirement under Article 36(1) not to own, develop, manage or operate energy storage facilities. 3. Where an exemption is granted under paragraph 2, the applicable tariffs, or the methodologies underlying their calculation, shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with Article 59(1) upon request by a user of the closed distribution system. 4. Incidental use by a small number of households with employment or similar associations with the owner of the distribution system and located within the area served by a closed distribution system shall not preclude an exemption under paragraph 2 being granted. Article 39 Combined operator Article 35(1) shall not prevent the operation of a combined transmission and distribution system operator, provided that the operator complies with Article 43(1), Articles 44 and 45, or Section 3 of Chapter VI, or that the operator falls under Article 66(3). CHAPTER V GENERAL RULES APPLICABLE TO TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATORS Article 40 Tasks of transmission system operators 1. Each transmission system operator shall be responsible for: (a) ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity, operating, maintaining and developing under economic conditions secure, reliable and efficient transmission system with due regard to the environment, in close cooperation with neighbouring transmission system operators and distribution system operators; (b) ensuring adequate means to meet its obligations; (c) contributing to security of supply through adequate transmission capacity and system reliability; (d) managing electricity flows on the system, taking into account exchanges with other interconnected systems. To that end, the transmission system operator shall be responsible for ensuring a secure, reliable and efficient electricity system and, in that context, for ensuring the availability of all necessary ancillary services, including those provided by demand response and energy storage facilities, insofar as such availability is independent from any other transmission systems with which its system is interconnected; (e) providing to the operator of other systems with which its system is interconnected sufficient information to ensure the secure and efficient operation, coordinated development and interoperability of the interconnected system; (f) ensuring non-discrimination as between system users or classes of system users, particularly in favour of its related undertakings; (g) providing system users with the information they need for efficient access to the system; (h) collecting congestion rents and payments under the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism, in accordance with Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, granting and managing third-party access and giving reasoned explanations when it denies such access, which shall be monitored by the regulatory authorities; in carrying out their tasks under this Article transmission system operators shall primarily facilitate market integration; (i) procuring ancillary services to ensure operational security; (j) adopting a framework for cooperation and coordination between the regional coordination centres; (k) participating in the establishment of the European and national resource adequacy assessments pursuant to Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) 2019/943; (l) the digitalisation of transmission systems; (m) data management, including the development of data management systems, cybersecurity and data protection, subject to the applicable rules, and without prejudice to the competence of other authorities. 2. Member States may provide that one or several responsibilities listed in paragraph 1 of this Article be assigned to a transmission system operator other than the one which owns the transmission system to which the responsibilities concerned would otherwise be applicable. The transmission system operator to which the tasks are assigned shall be certified under the ownership unbundling, the independent system operator or the independent transmission system operator model, and fulfil the requirements provided for in Article 43, but shall not be required to own the transmission system it is responsible for. The transmission system operator which owns the transmission system shall fulfil the requirements provided for in Chapter VI and be certified in accordance with Article 43. This shall be without prejudice to the possibility for transmission system operators which are certified under the ownership unbundling, the independent system operator or the independent transmission system operator model to delegate, on their own initiative and under their supervision, certain tasks to other transmission system operators which are certified under the ownership unbundling, the independent system operator or the independent transmission system operator model where that delegation of tasks does not endanger the effective and independent decision-making rights of the delegating transmission system operator. 3. In performing the tasks referred to in paragraph 1, transmission system operators shall take into account the recommendations issued by the regional coordination centres. 4. In performing the task referred to in point (i) of paragraph 1, transmission system operators shall procure balancing services subject to the following: (a) transparent, non-discriminatory and market-based procedures; (b) the participation of all qualified electricity undertakings and market participants, including market participants offering energy from renewable sources, market participants engaged in demand response, operators of energy storage facilities and market participants engaged in aggregation. For the purpose of point (b) of the first subparagraph, regulatory authorities and transmission system operators shall, in close cooperation with all market participants, establish technical requirements for participation in those markets, on the basis of the technical characteristics of those markets. 5. Paragraph 4 shall apply to the provision of non-frequency ancillary services by transmission system operators, unless the regulatory authority has assessed that the market-based provision of non-frequency ancillary services is economically not efficient and has granted a derogation. In particular, the regulatory framework shall ensure that transmission system operators are able to procure such services from providers of demand response or energy storage and shall promote the uptake of energy efficiency measures, where such services cost-effectively alleviate the need to upgrade or replace electricity capacity and support the efficient and secure operation of the transmission system. 6. Transmission system operators, subject to approval by the regulatory authority, or the regulatory authority itself, shall, in a transparent and participatory process that includes all relevant system users and the distribution system operators, establish the specifications for the non-frequency ancillary services procured and, where appropriate, standardised market products for such services at least at national level. The specifications shall ensure the effective and non-discriminatory participation of all market participants, including market participants offering energy from renewable sources, market participants engaged in demand response, operators of energy storage facilities and market participants engaged in aggregation. Transmission system operators shall exchange all necessary information and shall coordinate with distribution system operators in order to ensure the optimal utilisation of resources, to ensure the secure and efficient operation of the system and to facilitate market development. Transmission system operators shall be adequately remunerated for the procurement of such services to allow them to recover at least the reasonable corresponding costs, including the necessary information and communication technology expenses and infrastructure costs. 7. The obligation to procure non-frequency ancillary services referred to in paragraph 5 does not apply to fully integrated network components. 8. Member States or their designated competent authorities may allow transmission system operators to perform activities other than those provided for in this Directive and in Regulation (EU) 2019/943 where such activities are necessary for the transmission system operators to fulfil their obligations under this Directive or Regulation (EU) 2019/943, provided that the regulatory authority has assessed the necessity of such a derogation. This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the right of the transmission system operators to own, develop, manage or operate networks other than electricity networks where the Member State or the designated competent authority has granted such a right. Article 41 Confidentiality and transparency requirements for transmission system operators and transmission system owners 1. Without prejudice to Article 55 or another legal duty to disclose information, each transmission system operator and each transmission system owner shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information obtained in the course of carrying out its activities, and shall prevent information about its own activities which may be commercially advantageous from being disclosed in a discriminatory manner. In particular it shall not disclose any commercially sensitive information to the remaining parts of the undertaking, unless such disclosure is necessary for carrying out a business transaction. In order to ensure the full respect of the rules on information unbundling, Member States shall ensure that the transmission system owner and the remaining part of the undertaking do not use joint services, such as joint legal services, apart from purely administrative or IT functions. 2. Transmission system operators shall not, in the context of sales or purchases of electricity by related undertakings, misuse commercially sensitive information obtained from third parties in the context of providing or negotiating access to the system. 3. Information necessary for effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market shall be made public. That obligation shall be without prejudice to preserving the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information. Article 42 Decision-making powers regarding the connection of new generating installations and energy storage facilities to the transmission system 1. The transmission system operator shall establish and publish transparent and efficient procedures for non-discriminatory connection of new generating installations and energy storage facilities to the transmission system. Those procedures shall be subject to approval by the regulatory authorities. 2. The transmission system operator shall not be entitled to refuse the connection of a new generating installation or energy storage facility on the grounds of possible future limitations to available network capacities, such as congestion in distant parts of the transmission system. The transmission system operator shall supply necessary information. The first subparagraph shall be without prejudice to the possibility for transmission system operators to limit the guaranteed connection capacity or to offer connections subject to operational limitations, in order to ensure economic efficiency regarding new generating installations or energy storage facilities, provided that such limitations have been approved by the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority shall ensure that any limitations in guaranteed connection capacity or operational limitations are introduced on the basis of transparent and non-discriminatory procedures and do not create undue barriers to market entry. Where the generating installation or energy storage facility bears the costs related to ensuring unlimited connection, no limitation shall apply. 3. The transmission system operator shall not be entitled to refuse a new connection point, on the ground that it would lead to additional costs resulting from the necessary capacity increase of system elements in the close-up range to the connection point. CHAPTER VI UNBUNDLING OF TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATORS Section 1 Ownership unbundling Article 43 Ownership unbundling of transmission systems and transmission system operators 1. Member States shall ensure that: (a) each undertaking which owns a transmission system acts as a transmission system operator; (b) the same person or persons are not entitled either: (i) directly or indirectly to exercise control over an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply, and directly or indirectly to exercise control or exercise any right over a transmission system operator or over a transmission system; or (ii) directly or indirectly to exercise control over a transmission system operator or over a transmission system, and directly or indirectly to exercise control or exercise any right over an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply; (c) the same person or persons are not entitled to appoint members of the supervisory board, the administrative board or bodies legally representing the undertaking, of a transmission system operator or a transmission system, and directly or indirectly to exercise control or exercise any right over an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply; and (d) the same person is not entitled to be a member of the supervisory board, the administrative board or bodies legally representing the undertaking, of both an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply and a transmission system operator or a transmission system. 2. The rights referred to in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 shall include, in particular: (a) the power to exercise voting rights; (b) the power to appoint members of the supervisory board, the administrative board or bodies legally representing the undertaking; or (c) the holding of a majority share. 3. For the purpose of point (b) of paragraph 1, the notion undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply shall include undertaking performing any of the functions of production and supply within the meaning of Directive 2009/73/EC, and the terms transmission system operator and transmission system shall include transmission system operator and transmission system within the meaning of that Directive. 4. The obligation set out in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be fulfilled in a situation where two or more undertakings which own transmission systems have created a joint venture which acts as a transmission system operator in two or more Member States for the transmission systems concerned. No other undertaking may be part of the joint venture, unless it has been approved under Article 44 as an independent system operator or as an independent transmission operator for the purposes of Section 3. 5. For the implementation of this Article, where the person referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 is the Member State or another public body, two separate public bodies exercising control over a transmission system operator or over a transmission system on the one hand, and over an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply on the other, shall be deemed not to be the same person or persons. 6. Member States shall ensure that neither commercially sensitive information referred to in Article 41 held by a transmission system operator which was part of a vertically integrated undertaking, nor the staff of such a transmission system operator, is transferred to undertakings performing any of the functions of generation and supply. 7. Where on 3 September 2009, the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking a Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1. In such case, the Member State concerned shall either: (a) designate an independent system operator in accordance with Article 44; or (b) comply with Section 3. 8. Where, on 3 September 2009, the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking and there are arrangements in place which guarantee more effective independence of the transmission system operator than Section 3, a Member State may decide not to apply paragraph 1. 9. Before an undertaking is approved and designated as a transmission system operator under paragraph 8 of this Article, it shall be certified in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 52(4), (5), and (6) of this Directive and in Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, pursuant to which the Commission shall verify that the arrangements in place clearly guarantee more effective independence of the transmission system operator than Section 3 of this Chapter. 10. Vertically integrated undertakings which own a transmission system shall not in any event be prevented from taking steps to comply with paragraph 1. 11. Undertakings performing any of the functions of generation or supply shall not in any event be able to directly or indirectly take control over or exercise any right over unbundled transmission system operators in Member States which apply paragraph 1. Section 2 Independent system operator Article 44 Independent system operator 1. Where the transmission system belongs to a vertically integrated undertaking on 3 September 2009, Member States may decide not to apply Article 43(1) and designate an independent system operator upon a proposal from the transmission system owner. Such designation shall be subject to approval by the Commission. 2. The Member State may approve and designate an independent system operator provided that: (a) the candidate operator has demonstrated that it complies with the requirements laid down in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 43(1); (b) the candidate operator has demonstrated that it has at its disposal the required financial, technical, physical and human resources to carry out its tasks under Article 40; (c) the candidate operator has undertaken to comply with a ten-year network development plan monitored by the regulatory authority; (d) the transmission system owner has demonstrated its ability to comply with its obligations under paragraph 5. To that end, it shall provide all the draft contractual arrangements with the candidate operator and any other relevant entity; and (e) the candidate operator has demonstrated its ability to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2019/943, including the cooperation of transmission system operators at European and regional level. 3. Undertakings which have been certified by the regulatory authority as having complied with the requirements of Article 53 and paragraph 2 of this Article shall be approved and designated as independent system operators by Member States. The certification procedure in either Article 52 of this Directive and Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 or in Article 53 of this Directive shall be applicable. 4. Each independent system operator shall be responsible for granting and managing third-party access, including the collection of access charges, congestion charges, and payments under the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism in accordance with Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943, as well as for operating, maintaining and developing the transmission system, and for ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demand through investment planning. When developing the transmission system, the independent system operator shall be responsible for planning (including authorisation procedure), construction and commissioning of the new infrastructure. For this purpose, the independent system operator shall act as a transmission system operator in accordance with this Section. The transmission system owner shall not be responsible for granting and managing third-party access, nor for investment planning. 5. Where an independent system operator has been designated, the transmission system owner shall: (a) provide all the relevant cooperation and support to the independent system operator for the fulfilment of its tasks, including in particular all relevant information; (b) finance the investments decided by the independent system operator and approved by the regulatory authority, or give its agreement to financing by any interested party including the independent system operator. The relevant financing arrangements shall be subject to approval by the regulatory authority. Prior to such approval, the regulatory authority shall consult the transmission system owner together with the other interested parties; (c) provide for the coverage of liability relating to the network assets, excluding the liability relating to the tasks of the independent system operator; and (d) provide guarantees to facilitate financing any network expansions with the exception of those investments where, pursuant to point (b), it has given its agreement to financing by any interested party including the independent system operator. 6. In close cooperation with the regulatory authority, the relevant national competition authority shall be granted all relevant powers to effectively monitor compliance of the transmission system owner with its obligations under paragraph 5. Article 45 Unbundling of transmission system owners 1. A transmission system owner, where an independent system operator has been appointed, which is part of a vertically integrated undertaking shall be independent at least in terms of its legal form, organisation and decision-making from other activities not relating to transmission. 2. In order to ensure the independence of the transmission system owner referred to in paragraph 1, the following minimum criteria shall apply: (a) persons responsible for the management of the transmission system owner shall not participate in company structures of the integrated electricity undertaking responsible, directly or indirectly, for the day-to-day operation of the generation, distribution and supply of electricity; (b) appropriate measures shall be taken to ensure that the professional interests of persons responsible for the management of the transmission system owner are taken into account in a manner that ensures that they are capable of acting independently; and (c) the transmission system owner shall establish a compliance programme, which sets out measures taken to ensure that discriminatory conduct is excluded, and ensure that observance of it is adequately monitored. The compliance programme shall set out the specific obligations of employees to meet those objectives. An annual report, setting out the measures taken, shall be submitted by the person or body responsible for monitoring the compliance programme to the regulatory authority and shall be published. Section 3 Independent transmission operators Article 46 Assets, equipment, staff and identity 1. Transmission system operators shall be equipped with all human, technical, physical and financial resources necessary for fulfilling their obligations under this Directive and carrying out the activity of electricity transmission, in particular: (a) assets that are necessary for the activity of electricity transmission, including the transmission system, shall be owned by the transmission system operator; (b) personnel, necessary for the activity of electricity transmission, including the performance of all corporate tasks, shall be employed by the transmission system operator; (c) leasing of personnel and rendering of services, to and from other parts of the vertically integrated undertaking shall be prohibited. A transmission system operator may, however, render services to the vertically integrated undertaking, provided that: (i) the provision of those services does not discriminate between system users, is available to all system users on the same terms and conditions and does not restrict, distort or prevent competition in generation or supply; and (ii) the terms and conditions of the provision of those services are approved by the regulatory authority; (d) without prejudice to the decisions of the Supervisory Body under Article 49, appropriate financial resources for future investment projects and/or for the replacement of existing assets shall be made available to the transmission system operator in due time by the vertically integrated undertaking after an appropriate request from the transmission system operator. 2. The activity of electricity transmission shall include at least the following tasks in addition to those listed in Article 40: (a) the representation of the transmission system operator and contacts to third parties and the regulatory authorities; (b) the representation of the transmission system operator within the ENTSO for Electricity; (c) granting and managing third-party access on a non-discriminatory basis between system users or classes of system users; (d) the collection of all the transmission system related charges including access charges, energy for losses and ancillary services charges; (e) the operation, maintenance and development of a secure, efficient and economic transmission system; (f) investment planning ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demand and guaranteeing security of supply; (g) the setting up of appropriate joint ventures, including with one or more transmission system operators, power exchanges, and the other relevant actors pursuing the objectives to develop the creation of regional markets or to facilitate the liberalisation process; and (h) all corporate services, including legal services, accountancy and IT services. 3. Transmission system operators shall be organised in a legal form as referred to in Annex I to Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26). 4. The transmission system operator shall not, in its corporate identity, communication, branding and premises, create confusion with respect to the separate identity of the vertically integrated undertaking or any part thereof. 5. The transmission system operator shall not share IT systems or equipment, physical premises and security access systems with any part of the vertically integrated undertaking nor use the same consultants or external contractors for IT systems or equipment, and security access systems. 6. The accounts of transmission system operators shall be audited by an auditor other than the one auditing the vertically integrated undertaking or any part thereof. Article 47 Independence of the transmission system operator 1. Without prejudice to the decisions of the Supervisory Body under Article 49, the transmission system operator shall have: (a) effective decision-making rights, independent from the vertically integrated undertaking, with respect to assets necessary to operate, maintain or develop the transmission system; and (b) the power to raise money on the capital market in particular through borrowing and capital increase. 2. The transmission system operator shall at all times act so as to ensure it has the resources it needs in order to carry out the activity of transmission properly and efficiently and develop and maintain an efficient, secure and economic transmission system. 3. Subsidiaries of the vertically integrated undertaking performing functions of generation or supply shall not have any direct or indirect shareholding in the transmission system operator.

While plastic plays a useful role in the economy and provides essential applications in many sectors, its growing use in short-lived applications, which are not designed for re-use or cost-effective recycling, means that related production and consumption patterns have become increasingly inefficient and linear. Therefore, in the context of the Circular Economy Action Plan laid down in the Communication of the Commission of 2 December 2015 entitled Closing the loop  An EU action plan for the Circular Economy, the Commission concluded in the European Strategy for Plastics laid down in its Communication of 16 January 2018 entitled A European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy that the steady increase in plastic waste generation and the leakage of plastic waste into the environment, in particular into the marine environment, must be tackled in order to achieve a circular life cycle for plastics. The European Strategy for Plastics is a step towards establishing a circular economy in which the design and production of plastics and plastic products fully respect re-use, repair and recycling needs and in which more sustainable materials are developed and promoted. The significant negative environmental, health and economic impact of certain plastic products calls for the setting up of a specific legal framework to effectively reduce those negative effects. (2) This Directive promotes circular approaches that give priority to sustainable and non-toxic re-usable products and re-use systems rather than to single-use products, aiming first and foremost to reduce the quantity of waste generated. Such waste prevention is at the pinnacle of the waste hierarchy enshrined in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). This Directive will contribute to the achievement of United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 12 to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, which is part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 September 2015. By retaining the value of products and materials for as long as possible and generating less waste, the economy of the Union can become more competitive and more resilient, while reducing pressure on precious resources and the environment. (3) Marine litter is transboundary in nature and is recognised as a growing global problem. Reducing marine litter is a key action for the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 which calls to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The Union must play its part in preventing and tackling marine litter and aim to be a standard setter for the world. In that context, the Union is working with partners in many international fora such as G20, G7 and the UN to promote concerted action and this Directive is part of the Unions efforts in that regard. In order for those efforts to be effective, it is also important that exports of plastic waste from the Union do not result in increased marine litter elsewhere. (4) In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (UNCLOS) (5), the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter of 29 December 1972 (London Convention) and its 1996 Protocol (London Protocol), Annex V to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (MARPOL), as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, and the Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal of 22 March 1989 (6) and with Union waste legislation, namely Directive 2008/98/EC and Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), Member States are required to ensure environmentally sound waste management to prevent and reduce marine litter from both sea and land sources. In accordance with Union water legislation, namely Directives 2000/60/EC (8) and 2008/56/EC (9) of the European Parliament and of the Council, Member States are also required to tackle marine litter where it undermines the attainment of good environmental status of their marine waters, including as a contribution to UN Sustainable Development Goal 14. (5) In the Union, 80 to 85 % of marine litter, measured as beach litter counts, is plastic, with single-use plastic items representing 50 % and fishing-related items representing 27 % of the total. Single-use plastic products include a diverse range of commonly used fast-moving consumer products that are discarded after having been used once for the purpose for which they were provided, are rarely recycled, and are prone to becoming litter. A significant proportion of the fishing gear placed on the market is not collected for treatment. Single-use plastic products and fishing gear containing plastic are therefore a particularly serious problem in the context of marine litter, pose a severe risk to marine ecosystems, to biodiversity and to human health and damage activities such as tourism, fisheries and shipping. (6) Proper waste management remains essential for the prevention of all litter, including marine litter. Existing Union legislation, namely Directives 2008/98/EC, 2000/59/EC, 2000/60/EC and 2008/56/EC and Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (10), and policy instruments provide some regulatory responses to address marine litter. In particular, plastic waste is subject to overall Union waste management measures and targets, such as the recycling target for plastic packaging waste laid down in European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC (11) and the objective in the European Strategy for Plastics to ensure that by 2030 all plastic packaging placed on the Union market is re-usable or easily recycled. However, the impact of those measures on marine litter is not sufficient and there are differences in the scope and the level of ambition amongst national measures to prevent and reduce marine litter. In addition, some of those measures, in particular marketing restrictions for single-use plastic products, could create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Union. (7) To focus efforts where they are most needed, this Directive should cover only those single-use plastic products that are found the most on beaches in the Union as well as fishing gear containing plastic and products made from oxo-degradable plastic. The single-use plastic products covered by measures under this Directive are estimated to represent around 86 % of the single-use plastics found, in counts, on beaches in the Union. Glass and metal beverage containers should not be covered by this Directive as they are not among the single-use plastic products that are found the most on beaches in the Union. (8) Microplastics do not fall directly within the scope of this Directive, yet they contribute to marine litter and the Union should therefore adopt a comprehensive approach to that problem. The Union should encourage all producers to strictly limit microplastics in their formulations. (9) Terrestrial pollution and contamination of soil by larger items of plastic and resulting fragments or microplastics can be significant and such plastic can leak into the marine environment. (10) This Directive is a lex specialis in relation to Directives 94/62/EC and 2008/98/EC. In the event of a conflict between those Directives and this Directive, this Directive should prevail within the scope of its application. That is the case for restrictions on placing on the market. In particular with regard to consumption reduction measures, product requirements, marking requirements and extended producer responsibility, this Directive supplements Directives 94/62/EC and 2008/98/EC and Directive 2014/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). (11) Single-use plastic products can be manufactured from a wide range of plastics. Plastics are usually defined as polymeric materials to which additives may have been added. However, that definition would cover certain natural polymers. Unmodified natural polymers, within the meaning of the definition of not chemically modified substances in point 40 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), should not be covered by this Directive as they occur naturally in the environment. Therefore, for the purposes of this Directive, the definition of polymer in point 5 of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should be adapted and a separate definition should be introduced. Plastics manufactured with modified natural polymers, or plastics manufactured from bio-based, fossil or synthetic starting substances are not naturally occurring and should therefore be addressed by this Directive. The adapted definition of plastics should therefore cover polymer-based rubber items and bio-based and biodegradable plastics regardless of whether they are derived from biomass or are intended to biodegrade over time. Paints, inks and adhesives should not be addressed by this Directive and therefore these polymeric materials should not be covered by the definition. (12) In order to clearly define the scope of this Directive, the term single-use plastic product should be defined. The definition should exclude plastic products that are conceived, designed and placed on the market to accomplish within their life span multiple trips or rotations by being refilled or re-used for the same purpose for which they are conceived. Single-use plastic products are typically intended to be used just once or for a short period of time before being disposed of. Wet wipes for personal care and domestic use should also be within the scope of this Directive, whereas industrial wet wipes should be excluded. To further clarify whether a product is to be considered a single-use plastic product for the purposes of this Directive, the Commission should develop guidelines on single-use plastic products. In view of the criteria set out in this Directive, examples of food containers to be considered as single-use plastic products for the purposes of this Directive are fast-food containers or meal, sandwich, wrap and salad boxes with cold or hot food, or food containers of fresh or processed food that does not need further preparation, such as fruits, vegetables or desserts. Examples of food containers that are not to be considered as single-use plastic products for the purposes of this Directive are food containers with dried food or food that is sold cold requiring further preparation, containers containing food in more than single-serve portions or single-serve portion-sized food containers sold in more than one unit. Examples of beverage containers to be considered as single-use plastic products are beverage bottles or composite beverage packaging used for beer, wine, water, liquid refreshments, juices and nectars, instant beverages or milk, but not cups for beverages as these are a separate category of single-use plastic products for the purposes of this Directive. As they are not among the single-use plastic products that are found the most on beaches in the Union, glass and metal beverage containers should not be covered by this Directive. However, the Commission should, in the context of the review of this Directive, evaluate, inter alia, caps and lids made of plastic used for glass and metal beverage containers. (13) Single-use plastic products covered by this Directive should be addressed by one or several measures, depending on various factors, such as the availability of suitable and more sustainable alternatives, the feasibility of changing consumption patterns, and the extent to which they are already covered by existing Union legislation. (14) For certain single-use plastic products, suitable and more sustainable alternatives are not yet readily available and the consumption of most such single-use plastic products is expected to increase. To reverse that trend and to promote efforts towards more sustainable solutions, Member States should be required to take the necessary measures, for example by setting national consumption reduction targets, to achieve an ambitious and sustained reduction in the consumption of those products, without compromising food hygiene, food safety, good hygiene practices, good manufacturing practices, consumer information, or traceability requirements set out in Regulations (EC) No 178/2002 (14), (EC) No 852/2004 (15) and (EC) No 1935/2004 (16) of the European Parliament and of the Council and other relevant legislation related to food safety, hygiene and labelling. Member States should have the highest possible ambition for those measures, which should induce a substantial reversal of increasing consumption trends and lead to a measurable quantitative reduction. Those measures should take into account the impact of products throughout their life cycle, including when they are found in the marine environment, and should respect the waste hierarchy. Where Member States decide to implement that obligation through marketing restrictions, they should ensure that such restrictions are proportionate and non-discriminatory. Member States should encourage the use of products that are suitable for multiple use and that are, after having become waste, suitable for preparing for re-use and recycling. (15) For other single-use plastic products, suitable and more sustainable alternatives that are also affordable are readily available. In order to limit the adverse impact of such single-use plastic products on the environment, Member States should be required to prohibit their placing on the market. By doing so, the use of those readily available and more sustainable alternatives as well as of innovative solutions towards more sustainable business models, re-use alternatives and substitution of materials would be promoted. The restrictions on placing on the market introduced in this Directive should also cover products made from oxo-degradable plastic, as that type of plastic does not properly biodegrade and thus contributes to microplastic pollution in the environment, is not compostable, negatively affects the recycling of conventional plastic and fails to deliver a proven environmental benefit. Furthermore, in view of the high prevalence of expanded polystyrene litter in the marine environment and the availability of alternatives, single-use food and beverage containers and cups for beverages made of expanded polystyrene should also be restricted. (16) Tobacco product filters containing plastic are the second most found single-use plastic items on beaches in the Union. The huge environmental impact caused by post-consumption waste of tobacco products with filters containing plastic, discarded directly into the environment, needs to be reduced. Innovation and product development are expected to provide viable alternatives to filters containing plastic and need to be accelerated. Extended producer responsibility schemes for tobacco products with filters containing plastic should also encourage innovation leading to the development of sustainable alternatives to tobacco product filters containing plastic. Member States should promote a wide range of measures to reduce litter from post-consumption waste of tobacco products with filters containing plastic. (17) Caps and lids made of plastic which are used for beverage containers are among the single-use plastic items that are found the most on beaches in the Union. Therefore, beverage containers that are single-use plastic products should only be allowed to be placed on the market if they fulfil specific product design requirements that significantly reduce the dispersal into the environment of beverage container caps and lids made of plastic. For beverage containers that are both single-use plastic products and packaging, that requirement is in addition to the essential requirements on the composition and the re-usable and recoverable, including recyclable, nature of packaging set out in Annex II to Directive 94/62/EC. In order to facilitate conformity with the product design requirement and to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market, it is necessary to develop a harmonised standard adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (17), and compliance with that standard should give rise to a presumption of conformity with those requirements. Therefore, the timely development of a harmonised standard is of the highest priority in ensuring effective implementation of this Directive. Sufficient time should be envisaged for the development of a harmonised standard and to allow the producers to adapt their production chains in relation to the implementation of the product design requirement. In order to ensure the circular use of plastics, the market uptake of recycled materials needs to be promoted. It is therefore appropriate to introduce requirements for a mandatory minimum content of recycled plastic in beverage bottles. (18) Plastic products should be manufactured taking into account their entire life span. The design of plastic products should always take into account the production and use phase and the reusability and recyclability of the product. In the context of the review to be undertaken pursuant to Article 9(5) of Directive 94/62/EC, the Commission should take into account the relative properties of different packaging materials, including composite materials, on the basis of life cycle assessments, addressing in particular waste prevention and design for circularity. (19) The presence of hazardous chemical substances in sanitary towels, tampons and tampon applicators should be avoided in the interest of womens health. In the framework of the restrictions process under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, it is appropriate for the Commission to assess further restrictions on such substances. (20) Certain single-use plastic products end up in the environment as a result of inappropriate disposal through the sewer system or other inappropriate release into the environment. Disposal through the sewer system can in addition cause substantial economic damage to sewer networks by clogging pumps and blocking pipes. For those products, there is frequently a significant lack of information about the material characteristics of the product or the appropriate means of waste disposal. Therefore, single-use plastic products that are frequently disposed of through the sewer system or otherwise inappropriately disposed of should be subject to marking requirements. The marking should inform consumers about appropriate waste management options for the product or which waste disposal means are to be avoided for the product in line with the waste hierarchy, and about the presence of plastics in the product as well as the resulting negative environmental impact of littering or of other inappropriate means of disposal of the product. The marking should, as appropriate, be either on the packaging of the product or directly on the product itself. The Commission should be empowered to establish harmonised specifications for the marking and when doing so should, where appropriate, test the perception of the proposed marking with representative groups of consumers to ensure that it is effective and easily understandable. Marking requirements are already required for fishing gear pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. (21) With regard to single-use plastic products for which no suitable and more sustainable alternatives are readily available, Member States should, in line with the polluter-pays principle, also introduce extended producer responsibility schemes to cover the necessary costs of waste management and clean-up of litter as well as the costs of awareness raising measures to prevent and reduce such litter. Those costs should not exceed the costs that are necessary to provide those services in a cost-efficient way and should be established in a transparent way between the actors concerned. (22) Directive 2008/98/EC lays down general minimum requirements for extended producer responsibility schemes. Those requirements should apply to the extended producer responsibility schemes established by this Directive, irrespective of whether their mode of implementation is by legislative act or by means of agreements under this Directive. The relevance of some requirements depends on the characteristics of the product. Separate collection is not required to ensure proper treatment in line with the waste hierarchy for tobacco products with filters containing plastic, wet wipes and balloons. Therefore setting up separate collection for those products should not be mandatory. This Directive should establish extended producer responsibility requirements in addition to those laid down by Directive 2008/98/EC, for example, the requirement for producers of certain single-use plastic products to cover the costs of cleaning up litter. It should also be possible to cover the costs of the setting up of specific infrastructure for collection of post-consumption waste of tobacco products, such as appropriate waste receptacles in common litter hotspots. The calculation methodology for the costs of cleaning up litter should take into account considerations of proportionality. To minimise administrative costs, Member States should be able to determine financial contributions towards the costs of cleaning up litter by setting appropriate multiannual fixed amounts. (23) The large percentage of plastic stemming from discarded fishing gear, including abandoned and lost fishing gear, in marine litter indicates that the existing legal requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, Directive 2000/59/EC and Directive 2008/98/EC do not provide sufficient incentives to return such fishing gear to shore for collection and treatment. The indirect fee system set up under Directive (EU) 2019/883 of the European Parliament and of the Council (18) provides a system for removing the incentive for ships to discharge their waste at sea, and ensures a right of delivery. That system should, however, be supplemented by further financial incentives for fishermen to bring their waste fishing gear on shore to avoid any potential increase in the indirect waste fee to be paid. As plastic components of fishing gear have high recycling potential, Member States should, in line with the polluter-pays principle, introduce extended producer responsibility for fishing gear and components of fishing gear containing plastic to ensure separate collection of waste fishing gear and to finance environmentally sound waste management of waste fishing gear, in particular recycling. (24) In the framework of an extended producer responsibility for fishing gear containing plastic, Member States should monitor and assess, in line with the reporting obligations laid down in this Directive, fishing gear containing plastic. (25) While all marine litter containing plastic poses a risk to the environment and to human health and should be tackled, proportionality considerations should also be taken into account. Therefore, the fishermen themselves and artisanal makers of fishing gear containing plastic should not be considered as producers and should not be held responsible for fulfilling the obligations of the producer related to the extended producer responsibility. (26) Economic and other incentives to support sustainable consumer choices and promote responsible consumer behaviour can be an effective tool for achieving the objectives of this Directive. (27) Beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products are one of the marine litter items that are found the most on beaches in the Union. This is due to ineffective separate collection systems and low participation in those systems by consumers. It is necessary to promote more effective separate collection systems. Therefore, a minimum separate collection target should be established for beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products. While the obligation to separately collect waste requires that waste be kept separate by type and nature, it should be possible to collect certain types of waste together provided that this does not impede high-quality recycling in line with the waste hierarchy in accordance with Article 10(2) and point (a) of Article 10(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC. The setting of the separate collection target should be based on the amount of single-use plastic beverage bottles placed on the market in a Member State or alternatively on the amount of waste single-use plastic beverage bottles generated in a Member State. The calculation of the amount of waste generated in a Member State should take due account of all waste single-use plastic beverage bottles generated, including those which become litter instead of being disposed of through waste collection systems. Member States should be able to achieve that minimum target by setting separate collection targets for beverage bottles that are single-use plastic products in the framework of the extended producer responsibility schemes, by establishing deposit-refund schemes or by any other measure that they find appropriate. That will have a direct, positive impact on the collection rate, the quality of the collected material and the quality of the recyclates, offering opportunities for the recycling business and the market for the recyclates. It will support reaching the recycling targets for packaging waste set in Directive 94/62/EC. (28) In order to prevent littering and other inappropriate means of waste disposal resulting in marine litter containing plastic, it is necessary for consumers of single-use plastic products and users of fishing gear containing plastic to be properly informed about the availability of re-usable alternatives and re-use systems, the most appropriate waste management options available and/or which waste disposal options are to be avoided, about best practices with regard to sound waste management and the environmental impact of bad disposal practices, as well as about the plastic content in certain single-use plastic products and fishing gear and the impact of inappropriate waste disposal on the sewer network. Member States should therefore be required to take awareness raising measures ensuring that such information is provided to those consumers and users. The information should not contain any promotional content encouraging the use of single-use plastic products. Member States should be able to choose the measures which are the most appropriate based on the nature of the product or its use. Producers of single-use plastic products and fishing gear containing plastic should cover the costs of the awareness raising measures as part of their extended producer responsibility obligations. (29) The aim of this Directive is to protect the environment and human health. As the Court of Justice has held on numerous occasions, it would be incompatible with the binding effect which the third paragraph of Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ascribes to a Directive, to exclude, in principle, the possibility of an obligation imposed by a Directive from being relied on by persons concerned. That consideration applies particularly in respect of a Directive which has as its objective to prevent and reduce the impact of certain plastic products on the aquatic environment. (30) It is important to monitor the levels of marine litter in the Union in order to assess the implementation of this Directive. In accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC, Member States are required to regularly monitor the properties and quantities of marine litter, including plastic marine litter. That monitoring data is also to be communicated to the Commission. (31) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and should take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. (32) Pursuant to paragraph 22 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (19), the Commission should carry out an evaluation of this Directive. That evaluation should be based on experience gathered and data collected during the implementation of this Directive and data collected under Directives 2008/56/EC and 2008/98/EC. The evaluation should provide the basis for an assessment of possible further measures, including the setting of Union-wide reduction targets for 2030 and beyond, and an assessment whether, in view of monitoring of marine litter in the Union, the Annex listing single-use plastic products needs to be reviewed and whether the scope of this Directive can be broadened to other single-use products. (33) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in respect of the methodology for the calculation and verification of the annual consumption of single-use plastic products for which consumption reduction objectives have been set, the rules for the calculation and verification of the attainment of the targets on minimum recycled content for single-use plastic beverage bottles, the specifications for the marking to be affixed on certain single-use plastic products, the methodology for the calculation and verification of the collection targets of single-use plastic products for which separate collection targets have been set and the format for the reporting of data and information on the implementation of this Directive. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (20). (34) It is appropriate to allow Member States to choose to implement certain provisions of this Directive by means of agreements between the competent authorities and the economic sectors concerned, provided that certain requirements are met. (35) The fight against litter is a shared effort between competent authorities, producers and consumers. Public authorities, including the Union institutions, should lead by example. (36) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to prevent and to reduce the impact of certain single-use plastic products, products made from oxo-degradable plastic and fishing gear containing plastic on the environment and on human health, and to promote the transition to a circular economy, including the fostering of innovative and sustainable business models, products and materials, thus also contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Objectives The objectives of this Directive are to prevent and reduce the impact of certain plastic products on the environment, in particular the aquatic environment, and on human health, as well as to promote the transition to a circular economy with innovative and sustainable business models, products and materials, thus also contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market. Article 2 Scope 1. This Directive applies to the single-use plastic products listed in the Annex, to products made from oxo-degradable plastic and to fishing gear containing plastic. 2. Where this Directive conflicts with Directive 94/62/EC or 2008/98/EC, this Directive shall prevail.

Article 4 Consumption reduction 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to achieve an ambitious and sustained reduction in the consumption of the single-use plastic products listed in Part A of the Annex, in line with the overall objectives of the Unions waste policy, in particular waste prevention, leading to a substantial reversal of increasing consumption trends. Those measures shall achieve a measurable quantitative reduction in the consumption of the single-use plastic products listed in Part A of the Annex on the territory of the Member State by 2026 compared to 2022. By 3 July 2021, Member States shall prepare a description of the measures which they have adopted pursuant to the first subparagraph, notify the description to the Commission and make it publicly available. Member States shall integrate the measures set out in the description into the plans or programmes referred to in Article 11 upon the first subsequent update of those plans or programmes in accordance with the relevant legislative acts of the Union governing those plans or programmes, or into any other programmes drawn up specifically for that purpose. The measures may include national consumption reduction targets, measures ensuring that re-usable alternatives to the single-use plastic products listed in Part A of the Annex are made available at the point of sale to the final consumer, economic instruments such as instruments ensuring that those single-use plastic products are not provided free of charge at the point of sale to the final consumer and agreements as referred to in Article 17(3). Member States may impose marketing restrictions in derogation from Article 18 of Directive 94/62/EC for the purposes of preventing such products from becoming litter in order to ensure that they are substituted with alternatives that are re-usable or do not contain plastic. The measures may vary depending on the environmental impact of those single-use plastic products over their life cycle, including when they become litter. Measures adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall be proportionate and non-discriminatory. Member States shall notify the Commission of those measures in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council (23) where so required by that Directive. In order to comply with the first subparagraph of this paragraph, each Member State shall monitor the single-use plastic products listed in Part A of the Annex placed on the market and the reduction measures taken and shall report on progress made to the Commission in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article and Article 13(1) with a view to the establishment of binding quantitative Union targets for consumption reduction. 2. By 3 January 2021, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act laying down the methodology for the calculation and verification of the ambitious and sustained reduction in the consumption of the single-use plastic products listed in Part A of the Annex. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2). Article 5 Restrictions on placing on the market Member States shall prohibit the placing on the market of the single-use plastic products listed in Part B of the Annex and of products made from oxo-degradable plastic. Article 6 Product requirements 1. Member States shall ensure that single-use plastic products listed in Part C of the Annex that have caps and lids made of plastic may be placed on the market only if the caps and lids remain attached to the containers during the products intended use stage. 2. For the purposes of this Article, metal caps or lids with plastic seals shall not be considered to be made of plastic. 3. By 3 October 2019, the Commission shall request the European standardisation organisations to develop harmonised standards relating to the requirement referred to in paragraph 1. Those standards shall in particular address the need to ensure the necessary strength, reliability and safety of beverage container closures, including those for carbonated drinks. 4. From the date of publication of the references to harmonised standards referred to in paragraph 3 in the Official Journal of the European Union, single-use plastic products referred to in paragraph 1 which are in conformity with those standards or parts thereof shall be presumed to be in conformity with the requirement laid down in paragraph 1. 5. With regard to beverage bottles listed in Part F of the Annex, each Member State shall ensure that: (a) from 2025, beverage bottles listed in Part F of the Annex which are manufactured from polyethylene terephthalate as the major component (PET bottles) contain at least 25 % recycled plastic, calculated as an average for all PET bottles placed on the market on the territory of that Member State; and (b) from 2030, beverage bottles listed in Part F of the Annex contain at least 30 % recycled plastic, calculated as an average for all such beverage bottles placed on the market on the territory of that Member State. By 1 January 2022, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the rules for the calculation and verification of the targets established in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2). Article 7 Marking requirements 1. Member States shall ensure that each single-use plastic product listed in Part D of the Annex placed on the market bears a conspicuous, clearly legible and indelible marking on its packaging or on the product itself informing consumers of the following: (a) appropriate waste management options for the product or waste disposal means to be avoided for that product, in line with the waste hierarchy; and (b) the presence of plastics in the product and the resulting negative impact of littering or other inappropriate means of waste disposal of the product on the environment. The harmonised marking specifications shall be established by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 2. 2. By 3 July 2020, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act establishing harmonised specifications for the marking referred to in paragraph 1 that: (a) provide that the marking of single-use plastic products listed in points (1), (2) and (3) of Part D of the Annex shall be placed on the sales and grouped packaging of those products. Where multiple sales units are grouped at the point of purchase, each sales unit shall bear a marking on its packaging. The marking shall not be required for packaging with a surface area of less than 10 cm2; (b) provide that the marking of single-use plastic products listed in point (4) of Part D of the Annex shall be placed on the product itself; and (c) consider existing sectoral voluntary approaches and pay particular attention to the need to avoid information that misleads consumers. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2). 3. The provisions of this Article concerning tobacco products are in addition to those laid down in Directive 2014/40/EU. Article 8 Extended producer responsibility 1. Member States shall ensure that extended producer responsibility schemes are established for all single-use plastic products listed in Part E of the Annex which are placed on the market of the Member State, in accordance with Articles 8 and 8a of Directive 2008/98/EC. 2. Member States shall ensure that the producers of the single-use plastic products listed in Section I of Part E of the Annex to this Directive cover the costs pursuant to the extended producer responsibility provisions in Directives 2008/98/EC and 94/62/EC and, insofar as not already included, cover the following costs: (a) the costs of the awareness raising measures referred to in Article 10 of this Directive regarding those products; (b) the costs of waste collection for those products that are discarded in public collection systems, including the infrastructure and its operation, and the subsequent transport and treatment of that waste; and (c) the costs of cleaning up litter resulting from those products and the subsequent transport and treatment of that litter. 3. Member States shall ensure that the producers of the single-use plastic products listed in Sections II and III of Part E of the Annex cover at least the following costs: (a) the costs of the awareness raising measures referred to in Article 10 regarding those products; (b) the costs of cleaning up litter resulting from those products and the subsequent transport and treatment of that litter; and (c) the costs of data gathering and reporting in accordance with point (c) of Article 8a(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC. With regard to the single-use plastic products listed in Section III of Part E of the Annex to this Directive, Member States shall ensure that the producers cover, in addition, the costs of waste collection for those products that are discarded in public collection systems, including the infrastructure and its operation, and the subsequent transport and treatment of that waste. The costs may include the setting up of specific infrastructure for the waste collection for those products, such as appropriate waste receptacles in common litter hotspots. 4. The costs to be covered referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not exceed the costs that are necessary to provide the services referred to therein in a cost-efficient way and shall be established in a transparent way between the actors concerned. The costs of cleaning up litter shall be limited to activities undertaken by public authorities or on their behalf. The calculation methodology shall be developed in a way that allows for the costs of cleaning up litter to be established in a proportionate way. To minimise administrative costs, Member States may determine financial contributions towards the costs of cleaning up litter by setting appropriate multiannual fixed amounts. The Commission shall publish guidelines for criteria, in consultation with Member States, on the costs of cleaning up litter referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3. 5. Member States shall define in a clear way the roles and responsibilities of all relevant actors involved. With regard to packaging, those roles and responsibilities shall be defined in line with Directive 94/62/EC. 6. Each Member State shall allow the producers established in another Member State and placing products on its market to appoint a legal or natural person established on its territory as an authorised representative for the purposes of fulfilling the obligations of a producer related to extended producer responsibility schemes on its territory. 7. Each Member State shall ensure that a producer established on its territory, which sells single-use plastic products listed in Part E of the Annex and fishing gear containing plastic in another Member State in which it is not established, appoints an authorised representative in that other Member State. The authorised representative shall be the person responsible for fulfilling the obligations of that producer pursuant to this Directive on the territory of that other Member State. 8. Member States shall ensure that extended producer responsibility schemes are established for fishing gear containing plastic placed on the market of the Member State, in accordance with Articles 8 and 8a of Directive 2008/98/EC. Member States that have marine waters as defined in point 1 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/56/EC shall set a national minimum annual collection rate of waste fishing gear containing plastic for recycling. Member States shall monitor fishing gear containing plastic placed on the market of the Member State as well as waste fishing gear containing plastic collected and shall report to the Commission in accordance with Article 13(1) of this Directive with a view to the establishment of binding quantitative Union collection targets. 9. With regard to the extended producer responsibility schemes established pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Article, Member States shall ensure that the producers of fishing gear containing plastic cover the costs of the separate collection of waste fishing gear containing plastic that has been delivered to adequate port reception facilities in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/883 or to other equivalent collection systems that fall outside the scope of that Directive and the costs of its subsequent transport and treatment. The producers shall also cover the costs of the awareness raising measures referred to in Article 10 regarding fishing gear containing plastic. The requirements laid down in this paragraph supplement the requirements applicable to waste from fishing vessels in Union law on port reception facilities. Without prejudice to technical measures laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 (24), the Commission shall request the European standardisation organisations to develop harmonised standards relating to the circular design of fishing gear to encourage preparing for re-use and facilitate recyclability at end of life. Article 9 Separate collection 1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure the separate collection for recycling: (a) by 2025, of an amount of waste single-use plastic products listed in Part F of the Annex equal to 77 % of such single-use plastic products placed on the market in a given year by weight; (b) by 2029, of an amount of waste single-use plastic products listed in Part F of the Annex equal to 90 % of such single-use plastic products placed on the market in a given year by weight. Single-use plastic products listed in Part F of the Annex placed on the market in a Member State may be deemed to be equal to the amount of waste generated from such products, including as litter, in the same year in that Member State. In order to achieve that objective, Member States may inter alia: (a) establish deposit-refund schemes; (b) establish separate collection targets for relevant extended producer responsibility schemes. The first subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to point (a) of Article 10(3) of Directive 2008/98/EC. 2. The Commission shall facilitate the exchange of information and sharing of best practices among Member States on the appropriate measures to meet the targets laid down in paragraph 1, inter alia, on deposit-refund schemes. The Commission shall make the results of such exchange of information and sharing of best practices publicly available. 3. By 3 July 2020, the Commission shall adopt an implementing act laying down the methodology for the calculation and verification of the separate collection targets laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2). Article 10 Awareness raising measures Member States shall take measures to inform consumers and to incentivise responsible consumer behaviour, in order to reduce litter from products covered by this Directive, and shall take measures to inform consumers of the single-use plastic products listed in Part G of the Annex and users of fishing gear containing plastic about the following: (a) the availability of re-usable alternatives, re-use systems and waste management options for those single-use plastic products and for fishing gear containing plastic as well as best practices in sound waste management carried out in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2008/98/EC; (b) the impact of littering and other inappropriate waste disposal of those single-use plastic products and of fishing gear containing plastic on the environment, in particular on the marine environment; and (c) the impact of inappropriate means of waste disposal of those single-use plastic products on the sewer network. Article 11 Coordination of measures Without prejudice to the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of this Directive, each Member State shall ensure that the measures taken to transpose and implement this Directive form an integral part of and are consistent with its programmes of measures established in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2008/56/EC for those Member States that have marine waters, the programmes of measures established in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 2000/60/EC, waste management plans and waste prevention programmes established in accordance with Articles 28 and 29 of Directive 2008/98/EC and the waste reception and handling plans established under Directive (EU) 2019/883. The measures that Member States take to transpose and implement Articles 4 to 9 of this Directive shall comply with Union food law to ensure that food hygiene and food safety are not compromised. Member States shall encourage the use of sustainable alternatives to single-use plastic where possible for materials intended to come into contact with food. Article 12 Specifications and guidelines on single-use plastic products In order to determine whether a food container is to be considered as a single-use plastic product for the purposes of this Directive, in addition to the criteria listed in the Annex as regards food containers, its tendency to become litter, due to its volume or size, in particular single-serve portions, shall play a decisive role. By 3 July 2020, the Commission shall publish guidelines, in consultation with Member States, including examples of what is to be considered a single-use plastic product for the purposes of this Directive, as appropriate. Article 13 Information systems and reporting 1. Member States shall, for each calendar year, report to the Commission the following: (a) data on single-use plastic products listed in Part A of the Annex that have been placed on the market of the Member State each year, to demonstrate the consumption reduction in accordance with Article 4(1); (b) information on the measures taken by the Member State for the purposes of Article 4(1); (c) data on single-use plastic products listed in Part F of the Annex that have been separately collected in the Member State each year, to demonstrate the attainment of the separate collection targets in accordance with Article 9(1); (d) data on fishing gear containing plastic placed on the market and on waste fishing gear collected in the Member State each year; (e) information on recycled content in beverage bottles listed in Part F of the Annex to demonstrate the attainment of the targets laid down in Article 6(5); and (f) data on the post-consumption waste of single-use plastic products listed in Section III of Part E of the Annex that has been collected in accordance with Article 8(3). Member States shall report the data and information electronically within 18 months of the end of the reporting year for which they were collected. The data and information shall be reported in the format established by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article. The first reporting period shall be the calendar year 2022, with the exception of points (e) and (f) of the first subparagraph for which the first reporting period shall be the calendar year 2023. 2. The data and information reported by Member States in accordance with this Article shall be accompanied by a quality check report. The data and information shall be reported in the format established by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 4. 3. The Commission shall review the data and information reported in accordance with this Article and publish a report on the results of its review. The report shall assess the organisation of the collection of the data and information, the sources of data and information and the methodology used in Member States as well as the completeness, reliability, timeliness and consistency of that data and information. The assessment may include specific recommendations for improvement. The report shall be drawn up after the first reporting of the data and information by the Member States and thereafter at the intervals envisaged in Article 12(3c) of Directive 94/62/EC. 4. By 3 January 2021, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the format for reporting data and information in accordance with points (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 and with paragraph 2 of this Article. By 3 July 2020, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the format for reporting data in accordance with points (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 and with paragraph 2 of this Article. By 1 January 2022, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts laying down the format for reporting data and information in accordance with points (e) and (f) of paragraph 1 and with paragraph 2 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 16(2). The format developed according to Article 12 of Directive 94/62/EC shall be taken into consideration. Article 14 Penalties Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Member States shall, by 3 July 2021, notify the Commission of those rules and those measures and shall notify it of any subsequent amendment affecting them. Article 15 Evaluation and review 1.

This would increase the availability of accessible products and services in the internal market and improve the accessibility of relevant information. (2) The demand for accessible products and services is high and the number of persons with disabilities is projected to increase significantly. An environment where products and services are more accessible allows for a more inclusive society and facilitates independent living for persons with disabilities. In this context, it should be borne in mind that the prevalence of disability in the Union is higher among women than among men. (3) This Directive defines persons with disabilities in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted on 13 December 2006 (UN CRPD), to which the Union has been a Party since 21 January 2011 and which all Member States have ratified. The UN CRPD states that persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. This Directive promotes full and effective equal participation by improving access to mainstream products and services that, through their initial design or subsequent adaptation, address the particular needs of persons with disabilities. (4) Other persons who experience functional limitations, such as elderly persons, pregnant women or persons travelling with luggage, would also benefit from this Directive. The concept of persons with functional limitations, as referred to in this Directive, includes persons who have any physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments, age related impairments, or other human body performance related causes, permanent or temporary, which, in interaction with various barriers, result in their reduced access to products and services, leading to a situation that requires those products and services to be adapted to their particular needs. (5) The disparities between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of Member States concerning the accessibility of products and services for persons with disabilities, create barriers to the free movement of products and services and distort effective competition in the internal market. For some products and services, those disparities are likely to increase in the Union after the entry into force of the UN CRPD. Economic operators, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are particularly affected by those barriers. (6) Due to the differences in national accessibility requirements, individual professionals, SMEs and microenterprises in particular are discouraged from entering into business ventures outside their own domestic markets. The national, or even regional or local, accessibility requirements that Member States have put in place currently differ as regards both coverage and level of detail. Those differences negatively affect competitiveness and growth, due to the additional costs incurred in the development and marketing of accessible products and services for each national market. (7) Consumers of accessible products and services and of assistive technologies, are faced with high prices due to limited competition among suppliers. Fragmentation among national regulations reduces potential benefits derived from sharing with national and international peers experiences concerning responding to societal and technological developments. (8) The approximation of national measures at Union level is therefore necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market in order to put an end to fragmentation in the market of accessible products and services, to create economies of scale, to facilitate cross-border trade and mobility, as well as to help economic operators to concentrate resources on innovation instead of using those resources to cover expenses arising from fragmented legislation across the Union. (9) The benefits of harmonising accessibility requirements for the internal market have been demonstrated by the application of Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) regarding lifts and Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) in the area of transport. (10) In Declaration No 22, regarding persons with a disability, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Conference of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States agreed that, in drawing up measures under Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the institutions of the Union are to take account of the needs of persons with disabilities. (11) The overall aim of the communication of the Commission of 6 May 2015A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe, is to deliver sustainable economic and social benefits from a connected digital single market, thereby facilitating trade and promoting employment within the Union. Union consumers still do not enjoy the full benefits of prices and choice that the single market can offer, because cross-border online transactions are still very limited. Fragmentation also limits demand for cross-border e-commerce transactions. There is also a need for concerted action to ensure that electronic content, electronic communications services and access to audiovisual media services are fully available to persons with disabilities. It is therefore necessary to harmonise accessibility requirements across the digital single market and to ensure that all Union citizens, regardless of their abilities, can enjoy its benefits. (12) Since the Union became a Party to the UN CRPD, its provisions have become an integral part of the Union legal order and are binding upon the institutions of the Union and on its Member States. (13) The UN CRPD requires its Parties to take appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has identified the need to create a legislative framework with concrete, enforceable and time-bound benchmarks for monitoring the gradual implementation of accessibility. (14) The UN CRPD calls on its Parties to undertake or promote research and development of, and to promote the availability and use of, new technologies, including information and communications technologies, mobility aids, devices and assistive technologies, suitable for persons with disabilities. The UN CRPD also calls for priority to be given to affordable technologies. (15) The entry into force of the UN CRPD in the Member States legal orders entails the need to adopt additional national provisions on accessibility of products and services. Without Union action, those provisions would further increase disparities between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States. (16) It is therefore necessary to facilitate the implementation in the Union of the UN CRPD by providing common Union rules. This Directive also supports Member States in their efforts to fulfil their national commitments, as well as their obligations under the UN CRPD regarding accessibility in a harmonised manner. (17) The communication of the Commission of 15 November 2010European Disability Strategy 2010-2020  A Renewed Commitment to a Barrier-Free Europe  in line with the UN CRPD, identifies accessibility as one of the eight areas of action, indicates that it is a basic precondition for participation in society, and aims to ensure the accessibility of products and services. (18) The determination of the products and services falling within the scope of this Directive is based on a screening exercise which was carried out during the preparation of the Impact Assessment that identified relevant products and services for persons with disabilities, and for which Member States have adopted or are likely to adopt diverging national accessibility requirements disruptive to the functioning of the internal market. (19) In order to ensure the accessibility of the services falling within the scope of this Directive, products used in the provision of those services with which the consumer interacts should also be required to comply with the applicable accessibility requirements of this Directive. (20) Even if a service, or part of a service, is subcontracted to a third party, the accessibility of that service should not be compromised and the service providers should comply with the obligations of this Directive. Service providers should also ensure proper and continuous training of their personnel in order to ensure that they are knowledgeable about how to use accessible products and services. That training should cover issues such as information provision, advice and advertising. (21) Accessibility requirements should be introduced in the manner that is least burdensome for the economic operators and the Member States. (22) It is necessary to specify accessibility requirements for the placing on the market of products and services which fall within the scope of this Directive, in order to ensure their free movement in the internal market. (23) This Directive should make functional accessibility requirements compulsory and they should be formulated in terms of general objectives. Those requirements should be precise enough to create legally binding obligations and sufficiently detailed so as to make it possible to assess conformity in order to ensure the good functioning of the internal market for the products and services covered by this Directive, as well as leave a certain degree of flexibility in order to allow for innovation. (24) This Directive contains a number of functional performance criteria related to modes of operations of products and services. Those criteria are not meant as a general alternative to the accessibility requirements of this Directive but should be used in very specific circumstances only. Those criteria should apply to specific functions or features of the products or services, to make them accessible, when the accessibility requirements of this Directive do not address one or more of those specific functions or features. In addition, in the event that an accessibility requirement contains specific technical requirements, and an alternative technical solution for those technical requirements is provided in the product or service, this alternative technical solution should still comply with the related accessibility requirements, and should result in equivalent or increased accessibility, by applying the relevant functional performance criteria. (25) This Directive should cover consumer general purpose computer hardware systems. For those systems to perform in an accessible manner, their operating systems should also be accessible. Such computer hardware systems are characterised by their multipurpose nature and their ability to perform, with the appropriate software, the most common computing tasks requested by consumers and are intended to be operated by consumers. Personal computers, including desktops, notebooks, smartphones and tablets are examples of such computer hardware systems. Specialised computers embedded in consumer electronics products do not constitute consumer general purpose computer hardware systems. This Directive should not cover, on an individual basis, single components with specific functions, such as a mainboard or a memory chip, that are used or that might be used in such a system. (26) This Directive should also cover payment terminals, including both their hardware and software, and certain interactive self-service terminals, including both their hardware and software, dedicated to be used for the provision of services covered by this Directive: for example automated teller machines; ticketing machines issuing physical tickets granting access to services such as travel ticket dispensers; bank office queuing ticket machines; check-in machines; and interactive self-service terminals providing information, including interactive information screens. (27) However, certain interactive self-service terminals providing information installed as integrated parts of vehicles, aircrafts, ships or rolling stock should be excluded from the scope of this Directive, since these form part of those vehicles, aircrafts, ships or rolling stock which are not covered by this Directive. (28) This Directive should also cover electronic communications services including emergency communications as defined in Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). At present, the measures taken by Member States to provide access to persons with disabilities are divergent and are not harmonised throughout the internal market. Ensuring that the same accessibility requirements apply throughout the Union will lead to economies of scale for economic operators active in more than one Member State and facilitate the effective access for persons with disabilities, both in their own Member State and when travelling between Member States. For electronic communications services including emergency communications to be accessible, providers should, in addition to voice, provide real time text, and total conversation services where video is provided by them, ensuring the synchronisation of all those communication means. Member States should, in addition to the requirements of this Directive, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/1972, be able to determine a relay service provider that could be used by persons with disabilities. (29) This Directive harmonises accessibility requirements for electronic communications services and related products and complements Directive (EU) 2018/1972 which sets requirements on equivalent access and choice for end-users with disabilities. Directive (EU) 2018/1972 also sets requirements under universal service obligations on the affordability of internet access and voice communications and on the affordability and availability of related terminal equipment, specific equipment and services for consumers with disabilities. (30) This Directive should also cover consumer terminal equipment with interactive computing capability foreseeably to be primarily used to access electronic communications services. For the purposes of this Directive that equipment should be deemed to include equipment used as part of the setup in accessing electronic communications services such as a router or a modem. (31) For the purposes of this Directive, access to audiovisual media services should mean that the access to audiovisual content is accessible, as well as mechanisms that allow users with disabilities to use their assistive technologies. Services providing access to audiovisual media services could include websites, online applications, set-top box-based applications, downloadable applications, mobile device-based services including mobile applications and related media players as well as connected television services. Accessibility of audiovisual media services is regulated in Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), with the exception of the accessibility of electronic programme guides (EPGs) which are included in the definition of services providing access to audiovisual media services to which this Directive applies. (32) In the context of air, bus, rail and waterborne passenger transport services this Directive should cover, inter alia, the delivery of transport service information including real-time travel information through websites, mobile device-based services, interactive information screens and interactive self-service terminals, required by passengers with disabilities in order to travel. This could include information about the service providers passenger transport products and services, pre-journey information, information during the journey and information provided when a service is cancelled or its departure is delayed. Other elements of information could also include information on prices and promotions. (33) This Directive should also cover websites, mobile device-based services including mobile applications developed or made available by operators of passenger transport services within the scope of this Directive or on their behalf, electronic ticketing services, electronic tickets and interactive self-service terminals. (34) The determination of the scope of this Directive with regard to air, bus, rail and waterborne passenger transport services should be based on the existing sectorial legislation relating to passenger rights. Where this Directive does not apply to certain types of transport services, Member States should encourage service providers to apply the relevant accessibility requirements of this Directive. (35) Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) already lays down obligations for public sector bodies providing transport services, including urban and suburban transport services and regional transport services, to make their websites accessible. This Directive contains exemptions for microenterprises providing services, including urban and suburban transport services and regional transport services. In addition, this Directive includes obligations to ensure that e-commerce websites are accessible. Since this Directive contains obligations for the large majority of private transport service providers to make their websites accessible, when selling tickets online, it is not necessary to introduce in this Directive further requirements for the websites of urban and suburban transport service providers and regional transport service providers. (36) Certain elements of the accessibility requirements, in particular in relation to the provision of information as set out in this Directive, are already covered by existing Union law in the field of passenger transport. This includes elements of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), Regulation (EU) No 1177/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and Regulation (EU) No 181/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). This includes also relevant acts adopted on the basis of Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). To ensure regulatory consistency, the accessibility requirements set out in those Regulations and those acts should continue to apply as before. However, additional requirements of this Directive would supplement the existing requirements, improving the functioning of the internal market in the area of transport and benefiting persons with disabilities. (37) Certain elements of transport services should not be covered by this Directive when provided outside the territory of the Member States even where the service has been directed towards the Union market. With regard to those elements, a passenger transport service operator should only be obliged to ensure that the requirements of this Directive are met with regard to the part of the service offered within the territory of the Union. However, in the case of air transport, Union air carriers should ensure that the applicable requirements of this Directive are also satisfied on flights departing from an airport situated in a third country and flying to an airport situated within the territory of a Member State. Furthermore, all air carriers, including those which are not licenced in the Union, should ensure that the applicable requirements of this Directive are satisfied in cases where the flights depart from a Union territory to a third country territory. (38) Urban authorities should be encouraged to integrate barrier-free accessibility to urban transport services in their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), as well as to regularly publish lists of best practices regarding barrier-free accessibility to urban public transport and mobility. (39) Union law on banking and financial services aims to protect and provide information to consumers of those services across the Union but does not include accessibility requirements. With a view to enabling persons with disabilities to use those services throughout the Union, including where provided through websites and mobile device-based services including mobile applications, to make well-informed decisions, and to feel confident that they are adequately protected on an equal basis with other consumers, as well as ensure a level playing field for service providers, this Directive should establish common accessibility requirements for certain banking and financial services provided to consumers. (40) The appropriate accessibility requirements should also apply to identification methods, electronic signature and payment services, since they are necessary for concluding consumer banking transactions. (41) E-book files are based on a electronic computer coding that enables the circulation and consultation of a mostly textual and graphical intellectual work. The degree of precision of this coding determines the accessibility of e-book files, in particular regarding the qualification of the different constitutive elements of the work and the standardised description of its structure. The interoperability in terms of accessibility should optimise the compatibility of those files with the user agents and with current and future assistive technologies. Specific features of special volumes like comics, childrens books and art books should be considered in the light of all applicable accessibility requirements. Divergent accessibility requirements in Member States would make it difficult for publishers and other economic operators to benefit from the advantages of the internal market, could create interoperability problems with e-readers and would limit the access for consumers with disabilities. In the context of e-books, the concept of a service provider could include publishers and other economic operators involved in their distribution. It is recognised that persons with disabilities continue to face barriers to accessing content which is protected by copyright and related rights, and that certain measures have already been taken to address this situation for example through the adoption of Directive (EU) 2017/1564 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) and Regulation (EU) 2017/1563 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), and that further Union measures could be taken in this respect in the future. (42) This Directive defines e-commerce services as a service provided at a distance, through websites and mobile device-based services, by electronic means and at the individual request of a consumer, with a view to concluding a consumer contract. For the purposes of that definition at a distance means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present; by electronic means means that the service is initially sent and received at its destination by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) and storage of data, and transmitted, conveyed and received in its entirety by wire, by radio, by optical means or by other electromagnetic means; at the individual request of a consumer means that the service is provided on individual request. Given the increased relevance of e-commerce services and their high technological nature, it is important to have harmonised requirements for their accessibility. (43) The e-commerce services accessibility obligations of this Directive should apply to the online sale of any product or service and should therefore also apply to the sale of a product or service covered in its own right under this Directive. (44) The measures related to the accessibility of the answering of emergency communications should be adopted without prejudice to, and should have no impact on, the organisation of emergency services, which remains in the exclusive competence of Member States. (45) In accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/1972, Member States are to ensure that access for end-users with disabilities to emergency services is available through emergency communications and is equivalent to that enjoyed by other end-users, in accordance with Union law harmonising accessibility requirements for products and services. The Commission and the national regulatory or other competent authorities are to take appropriate measures to ensure that, whilst travelling in another Member State, end-users with disabilities can access emergency services on an equivalent basis with other end-users, where feasible without any pre-registration. Those measures seek to ensure interoperability across Member States and are to be based, to the greatest extent possible, on European standards or specifications laid down in accordance with Article 39 of Directive (EU) 2018/1972. Such measures do not prevent Member States from adopting additional requirements in order to pursue the objectives set out in that Directive. As an alternative to fulfilling the accessibility requirements with regard to the answering of emergency communications for users with disabilities set out in this Directive, Member States should be able to determine a third party relay service provider to be used by persons with disabilities to communicate with the public safety answering point, until those public safety answering points are capable of using electronic communications services through internet protocols for ensuring accessibility of answering the emergency communications. In any case, obligations of this Directive should not be understood to restrict or lower any obligations for the benefit of end-users with disabilities, including equivalent access to electronic communications services and emergency services as well as accessibility obligations as set out in Directive (EU) 2018/1972. (46) Directive (EU) 2016/2102 defines accessibility requirements for websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies and other related aspects, in particular requirements relating to the compliance of the relevant websites and mobile applications. However, that Directive contains a specific list of exceptions. Similar exceptions are relevant for this Directive. Some activities that take place via websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies, such as passenger transport services or e-commerce services, which fall within the scope of this Directive, should in addition comply with the applicable accessibility requirements of this Directive in order to ensure that the online sale of products and services is accessible for persons with disabilities irrespective whether the seller is a public or private economic operator. The accessibility requirements of this Directive should be aligned to the requirements of Directive (EU) 2016/2102, despite differences, for example, in monitoring, reporting and enforcement. (47) The four principles of accessibility of websites and mobile applications, as used in Directive (EU) 2016/2102, are: perceivability, meaning that information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive; operability, meaning that user interface components and navigation must be operable; understandability, meaning that information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable; and robustness, meaning that content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. Those principles are also relevant for this Directive. (48) Member States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that, where the products and services covered by this Directive comply with the applicable accessibility requirements, their free movement within the Union is not impeded for reasons related to accessibility requirements. (49) In some situations, common accessibility requirements of the built environment would facilitate the free movement of the related services and of persons with disabilities. Therefore, this Directive should enable Member States to include the built environment used in the provision of the services under the scope of this Directive, ensuring compliance with the accessibility requirements set out in Annex III. (50) Accessibility should be achieved by the systematic removal and prevention of barriers, preferably through a universal design or design for all approach, which contributes to ensuring access for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others. According to the UN CRPD, that approach means the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. In line with the UN CRPD, universal design shall not exclude assistive devices for particular groups of persons with disabilities where this is needed. Furthermore, accessibility should not exclude the provision of reasonable accommodation when required by Union law or national law. Accessibility and universal design should be interpreted in line with General Comment No 2(2014)  Article 9: Accessibility as written by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. (51) Products and services falling within the scope of this Directive do not automatically fall within the scope of Council Directive 93/42/EEC (16). However, some assistive technologies which are medical devices, might fall within the scope of that Directive. (52) Most jobs in the Union are provided by SMEs and microenterprises. They have a crucial importance for future growth, but very often face hurdles and obstacles in developing their products or services, in particular in the cross-border context. It is therefore necessary to facilitate the work of the SMEs and microenterprises by harmonising the national provisions on accessibility while maintaining the necessary safeguards. (53) For microenterprises and SMEs to benefit from this Directive they must genuinely fulfil the requirements of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (17), and the relevant case law, aimed at preventing the circumvention of its rules. (54) In order to ensure the consistency of Union law, this Directive should be based on Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (18), since it concerns products already subject to other Union acts, while recognising the specific features of the accessibility requirements of this Directive. (55) All economic operators falling within the scope of this Directive and intervening in the supply and distribution chain should ensure that they make available on the market only products which are in conformity with this Directive. The same should apply to economic operators providing services. It is necessary to provide for a clear and proportionate distribution of obligations which correspond to the role of each economic operator in the supply and distribution process. (56) Economic operators should be responsible for the compliance of products and services, in relation to their respective roles in the supply chain, so as to ensure a high level of protection of accessibility and to guarantee fair competition on the Union market. (57) The obligations of this Directive should apply equally to economic operators from the public and private sectors. (58) The manufacturer having detailed knowledge of the design and production process is best placed to carry out the complete conformity assessment. While the responsibility for the conformity of products rests with the manufacturer, market surveillance authorities should play a crucial role in checking whether products made available in the Union are manufactured in accordance with Union law. (59) Importers and distributors and should be involved in market surveillance tasks carried out by national authorities, and should participate actively, providing the competent authorities with all necessary information relating to the product concerned. (60) Importers should ensure that products from third countries entering the Union market comply with this Directive and in particular that appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been carried out by manufacturers with regard to those products. (61) When placing a product on the market, importers should indicate, on the product, their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and the address at which they can be contacted. (62) Distributors should ensure that their handling of the product does not adversely affect the compliance of the product with the accessibility requirements of this Directive. (63) Any economic operator that either places a product on the market under its name or trademark or modifies a product already placed on the market in such a way that compliance with applicable requirements might be affected should be considered to be the manufacturer and should assume the obligations of the manufacturer. (64) For reasons of proportionality, accessibility requirements should only apply to the extent that they do not impose a disproportionate burden on the economic operator concerned, or to the extent that they do not require a significant change in the products and services which would result in their fundamental alteration in the light of this Directive. Control mechanisms should nevertheless be in place in order to verify entitlement to exceptions to the applicability of accessibility requirements. (65) This Directive should follow the principle of think small first and should take account of the administrative burdens that SMEs are faced with. It should set light rules in terms of conformity assessment and should establish safeguard clauses for economic operators, rather than providing for general exceptions and derogations for those enterprises. Consequently, when setting up the rules for the selection and implementation of the most appropriate conformity assessment procedures, the situation of SMEs should be taken into account and the obligations to assess conformity of accessibility requirements should be limited to the extent that they do not impose a disproportionate burden on SMEs. In addition, market surveillance authorities should operate in a proportionate manner in relation to the size of undertakings and to the small serial or non-serial nature of the production concerned, without creating unnecessary obstacles for SMEs and without compromising the protection of public interest. (66) In exceptional cases, where the compliance with accessibility requirements of this Directive would impose a disproportionate burden on economic operators, economic operators should only be required to comply with those requirements to the extent that they do not impose a disproportionate burden. In such duly justified cases, it would not be reasonably possible for an economic operator to fully apply one or more of the accessibility requirements of this Directive. However, the economic operator should make a service or a product that falls within the scope of this Directive as accessible as possible by applying those requirements to the extent that they do not impose a disproportionate burden. Those accessibility requirements which were not considered by the economic operator to impose a disproportionate burden should apply fully. Exceptions to compliance with one or more accessibility requirements due to the disproportionate burden that they impose should not go beyond what is strictly necessary in order to limit that burden with respect to the particular product or service concerned in each individual case. Measures that would impose a disproportionate burden should be understood as measures that would impose an additional excessive organisational or financial burden on the economic operator, while taking into account the likely resulting benefit for persons with disabilities in line with the criteria set out in this Directive. Criteria based on these considerations should be defined in order to enable both economic operators and relevant authorities to compare different situations and to assess in a systematic way whether a disproportionate burden exists. Only legitimate reasons should be taken into account in any assessment of the extent to which the accessibility requirements cannot be met because they would impose a disproportionate burden. Lack of priority, time or knowledge should not be considered to be legitimate reasons. (67) The overall assessment of a disproportionate burden should be done using the criteria set out in Annex VI. The assessment of disproportionate burden should be documented by the economic operator taking into account the relevant criteria. Service providers should renew their assessment of a disproportionate burden at least every five years. (68) The economic operator should inform the relevant authorities that it has relied on the provisions of this Directive related to fundamental alteration and/or disproportionate burden. Only upon a request from the relevant authorities should the economic operator provide a copy of the assessment explaining why its product or service is not fully accessible and providing evidence of the disproportionate burden or fundamental alteration, or both. (69) If on the basis of the required assessment, a service provider concludes that it would constitute a disproportionate burden to require that all self-service terminals, used in the provision of services covered by this Directive, comply with the accessibility requirements of this Directive, the service provider should still apply those requirements to the extent that those requirements do not impose such a disproportionate burden on it. Consequently, the service providers should assess the extent to which a limited level of accessibility in all self-service terminals or a limited number of fully accessible self-service terminals would enable them to avoid a disproportionate burden that would otherwise be imposed on them, and should be required to comply with the accessibility requirements of this Directive only to that extent. (70) Microenterprises are distinguished from all other undertakings by their limited human resources, annual turnover or annual balance sheet. The burden of complying with the accessibility requirements for microenterprises therefore, in general, takes a greater share of their financial and human resources than for other undertakings and is more likely to represent a disproportionate share of the costs. A significant proportion of cost for microenterprises comes from completing or keeping paperwork and records to demonstrate compliance with the different requirements set out in Union law. While all economic operators covered by this Directive should be able to assess the proportionality of complying with the accessibility requirements of this Directive and should only comply with them to the extent they are not disproportionate, demanding such an assessment from microenterprises providing services would in itself constitute a disproportionate burden. The requirements and obligations of this Directive should therefore not apply to microenterprises providing services within the scope of this Directive. (71) For microenterprises dealing with products falling within the scope of this Directive the requirements and obligations of this Directive should be lighter in order to reduce the administrative burden. (72) While some microenterprises are exempted from the obligations of this Directive, all microenterprises should be encouraged to manufacture, import or distribute products and to provide services that comply with the accessibility requirements of this Directive, in order to increase their competitiveness as well as their growth potential in the internal market. Member States should, therefore, provide guidelines and tools to microenterprises to facilitate the application of national measures transposing this Directive. (73) All economic operators should act responsibly and in full accordance with the legal requirements applicable when placing or making products available on the market or providing services on the market. (74) In order to facilitate the assessment of conformity with the applicable accessibility requirements it is necessary to provide for a presumption of conformity for products and services which are in conformity with voluntary harmonised standards that are adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) for the purpose of drawing up detailed technical specifications of those requirements. The Commission has already issued a number of standardisation requests to the European standardisation organisations on accessibility, such as standardisation mandates M/376, M/473 and M/420, which would be relevant for the preparation of harmonised standards. (75) Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 provides for a procedure for formal objections to harmonised standards that are considered not to comply with the requirements of this Directive. (76) European standards should be market-driven, take into account the public interest, as well as the policy objectives clearly stated in the Commissions request to one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards, and be based on consensus. In the absence of harmonised standards and where needed for internal market harmonisation purposes, the Commission should be able to adopt in certain cases implementing acts establishing technical specifications for the accessibility requirements of this Directive. Recourse to technical specifications should be limited to such cases. The Commission should be able to adopt technical specifications for instance when the standardisation process is blocked due to a lack of consensus between stakeholders or there are undue delays in the establishment of a harmonised standard, for example because the required quality is not reached. The Commission should leave enough time between the adoption of a request to one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards and the adoption of a technical specification related to the same accessibility requirement. The Commission should not be allowed to adopt a technical specification if it has not previously tried to have the accessibility requirements covered through the European standardisation system, except where the Commission can demonstrate that the technical specifications respect the requirements laid down in Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. (77) With a view to establishing, in the most efficient way, harmonised standards and technical specifications that meet the accessibility requirements of this Directive for products and services, the Commission should, where this is feasible, involve European umbrella organisations of persons with disabilities and all other relevant stakeholders in the process. (78) To ensure effective access to information for market surveillance purposes, the information required to declare compliance with all applicable Union acts should be made available in a single EU declaration of conformity. In order to reduce the administrative burden on economic operators, they should be able to include in the single EU declaration of conformity all relevant individual declarations of conformity. (79) For conformity assessment of products, this Directive should use the Internal production control of Module A, set out in Annex II to Decision No 768/2008/EC, as it enables economic operators to demonstrate, and the competent authorities to ensure, that products made available on the market conform to the accessibility requirements while not imposing an undue burden. (80) When carrying out market surveillance of products and checking compliance of services, authorities should also check the conformity assessments, including whether the relevant assessment of fundamental alteration or disproportionate burden was properly carried out. When carrying out their duties authorities should also do so in cooperation with persons with disabilities and the organisations that represent them and their interests. (81) For services, the information necessary to assess conformity with the accessibility requirements of this Directive should be provided in the general terms and conditions, or in an equivalent document, without prejudice to Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (20). (82) The CE marking, indicating the conformity of a product with the accessibility requirements of this Directive, is the visible consequence of a whole process comprising conformity assessment in a broad sense. This Directive should follow the general principles governing the CE marking of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (21) setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products. In addition to making the EU declaration of conformity, the manufacturer should inform consumers in a cost-effective manner about the accessibility of their products. (83) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, by affixing the CE marking to a product, the manufacturer declares that the product is in conformity with all applicable accessibility requirements and that the manufacturer takes full responsibility therefor. (84) In accordance with Decision No 768/2008/EC, Member States are responsible for ensuring strong and efficient market surveillance of products in their territories and should allocate sufficient powers and resources to their market surveillance authorities. (85) Member States should check the compliance of services with the obligations of this Directive and should follow up complaints or reports related to non-compliance in order to ensure that corrective action has been taken. (86) Where appropriate the Commission, in consultation with stakeholders, could adopt non-binding guidelines to support coordination among market surveillance authorities and authorities responsible for checking compliance of services. The Commission and Member States should be able to set up initiatives for the purpose of sharing the resources and expertise of authorities. (87) Member States should ensure that market surveillance authorities and authorities responsible for checking compliance of services check the compliance of the economic operators with the criteria set out in Annex VI in accordance with Chapters VIII and IX. Member States should be able to designate a specialised body for carrying out the obligations of market surveillance authorities or authorities responsible for checking compliance of services under this Directive. Member States should be able to decide that the competences of such a specialised body should be limited to the scope of this Directive or certain parts thereof, without prejudice to the Member States obligations under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. (88) A safeguard procedure should be set up to apply in the event of disagreement between Member States over measures taken by a Member State under which interested parties are informed of measures intended to be taken with regard to products not complying with the accessibility requirements of this Directive. The safeguard procedure should allow market surveillance authorities, in cooperation with the relevant economic operators, to act at an earlier stage in respect of such products. (89) Where the Member States and the Commission agree that a measure taken by a Member State is justified, no further involvement of the Commission should be required, except where non-compliance can be attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards or in the technical specifications. (90) Directives 2014/24/EU (22) and 2014/25/EU (23) of the European Parliament and of the Council on public procurement, defining procedures for the procurement of public contracts and design contests for certain supplies (products), services and works, establish that, for all procurement which is intended for use by natural persons, whether general public or staff of the contracting authority or entity, the technical specifications are, except in duly justified cases, to be drawn up so as to take into account accessibility criteria for persons with disabilities or design for all users. Furthermore, those Directives require that, where mandatory accessibility requirements are adopted by a legal act of the Union, technical specifications are, as far as accessibility for persons with disabilities or design for all users are concerned, to be established by reference thereto. This Directive should establish mandatory accessibility requirements for products and services covered by it. For products and services not falling under the scope of this Directive, the accessibility requirements of this Directive are not binding. However, the use of those accessibility requirements to fulfil the relevant obligations set out in Union acts other than this Directive would facilitate the implementation of accessibility and contribute to the legal certainty and to the approximation of accessibility requirements across the Union. Authorities should not be prevented from establishing accessibility requirements that go beyond the accessibility requirements set out in Annex I to this Directive. (91) This Directive should not change the compulsory or voluntary nature of the provisions related to accessibility in other Union acts. (92) This Directive should only apply to procurement procedures for which the call for competition has been sent or, in cases where a call for competition is not foreseen, where the contracting authority or contracting entity has commenced the procurement procedure after the date of application of this Directive. (93) In order to ensure the proper application of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of: further specifying the accessibility requirements that, by their very nature, cannot produce their intended effect unless they are further specified in binding legal acts of the Union; changing the period during which economic operators are to be able to identify any other economic operator who has supplied them with a product or to whom they have supplied a product; and further specifying the relevant criteria that are to be taken into account by the economic operator for the assessment of whether compliance with the accessibility requirements would impose a disproportionate burden. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (24). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (94) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Directive, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission with regard to the technical specifications. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25). (95) Member States should ensure that adequate and effective means exist to ensure compliance with this Directive and should therefore establish appropriate control mechanisms, such as a posteriori control by the market surveillance authorities, in order to verify that the exemption from the accessibility requirements application is justified. When dealing with complaints related to accessibility, Member States should comply with the general principle of good administration, and in particular with the obligation of officials to ensure that a decision on each complaint is taken within a reasonable time-limit. (96) In order to facilitate the uniform implementation of this Directive, the Commission should establish a working group consisting of relevant authorities and stakeholders to facilitate exchange of information and of best practices and to provide advice. Cooperation should be fostered between authorities and relevant stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organisations that represent them, inter alia, to improve coherence in the application of provisions of this Directive concerning accessibility requirements and to monitor implementation of its provisions on fundamental alteration and disproportionate burden. (97) Given the existing legal framework concerning remedies in the areas covered by Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU, the provisions of this Directive relating to enforcement and penalties should not be applicable to the procurement procedures subject to the obligations imposed by this Directive. Such exclusion is without prejudice to the obligations of Member States under the Treaties to take all measures necessary to guarantee the application and effectiveness of Union law. (98) Penalties should be adequate in relation to the character of the infringements and to the circumstances so as not to serve as an alternative to the fulfilment by economic operators of their obligations to make their products or services accessible. (99) Member States should ensure that, in accordance with existing Union law, alternative dispute resolutions mechanisms are in place that allow the resolution of any alleged non-compliance with this Directive prior to an action being brought before courts or competent administrative bodies. (100) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (26), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a Directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. (101) In order to allow service providers sufficient time to adapt to the requirements of this Directive, it is necessary to provide for a transitional period of five years after the date of application of this Directive, during which products used for the provision of a service which were placed on the market before that date do not need to comply with the accessibility requirements of this Directive unless they are replaced by the service providers during the transitional period. Given the cost and long life-cycle of self-service terminals, it is appropriate to provide that, when such terminals are used in the provision of services, they may continue to be used until the end of their economic life, as long as they are not replaced during that period, but not for longer than 20 years. (102) The accessibility requirements of this Directive should apply to products placed on the market and services provided after the date of application of the national measures transposing this Directive, including used and second-hand products imported from a third country and placed on the market after that date. (103) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter). In particular, this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for the rights of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community and to promote the application of Articles 21, 25 and 26 of the Charter. (104) Since the objective of this Directive, namely, the elimination of barriers to the free movement of certain accessible products and services, in order to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because it requires the harmonisation of different rules currently existing in their respective legal systems, but can rather, by defining common accessibility requirements and rules for the functioning of the internal market, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I General provisions Article 1 Subject matter The purpose of this Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by approximating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States as regards accessibility requirements for certain products and services by, in particular, eliminating and preventing barriers to the free movement of products and services covered by this Directive arising from divergent accessibility requirements in the Member States.

CHAPTER II Accessibility requirements and free movement Article 4 Accessibility requirements 1. Member States shall ensure, in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of this Article and subject to Article 14, that economic operators only place on the market products and only provide services that comply with the accessibility requirements set out in Annex I. 2. All products shall comply with the accessibility requirements set out in Section I of Annex I. All products, except for self-service terminals, shall comply with the accessibility requirements set out in Section II of Annex I. 3.

CHAPTER V Fundamental alteration of products or services and disproportionate burden to economic operators Article 14 Fundamental alteration and disproportionate burden 1. The accessibility requirements referred to in Article 4 shall apply only to the extent that compliance: (a) does not require a significant change in a product or service that results in the fundamental alteration of its basic nature; and (b) does not result in the imposition of a disproportionate burden on the economic operators concerned. 2. Economic operators shall carry out an assessment of whether compliance with the accessibility requirements referred to in Article 4 would introduce a fundamental alteration or, based on the relevant criteria set out in Annex VI, impose a disproportionate burden, as provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article. 3. Economic operators shall document the assessment referred to in paragraph 2. Economic operators shall keep all relevant results for a period of five years to be calculated from the last making available of a product on the market or after a service was last provided, as applicable. Upon a request from the market surveillance authorities or from the authorities responsible for checking compliance of services, as applicable, the economic operators shall provide the authorities with a copy of the assessment referred to in paragraph 2. 4. By way of derogation from paragraph 3, microenterprises dealing with products shall be exempted from the requirement to document their assessment. However, if a market surveillance authority so requests, microenterprises dealing with products and which have chosen to rely on paragraph 1 shall provide the authority with the facts relevant to the assessment referred to in paragraph 2. 5. Service providers relying on point (b) of paragraph 1 shall, with regard to each category or type of service, renew their assessment of whether the burden is disproportionate: (a) when the service offered is altered; or (b) when requested to do so by the authorities responsible for checking compliance of services; and (c) in any event, at least every five years. 6. Where economic operators receive funding from other sources than the economic operators own resources, whether public or private, that is provided for the purpose of improving accessibility, they shall not be entitled to rely on point (b) of paragraph 1. 7. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 26 to supplement Annex VI by further specifying the relevant criteria that are to be taken into account by the economic operator for the assessment referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. When further specifying those criteria, the Commission shall take into account not only the potential benefits for persons with disabilities, but also those for persons with functional limitations. When necessary, the Commission shall adopt the first such delegated act by 28 June 2020. Such act shall start to apply, at the earliest, in 28 June 2025. 8. Where economic operators rely on paragraph 1 for a specific product or service they shall send information to that effect to the relevant market surveillance authorities, or authorities responsible for checking the compliance of services, of the Member State where the specific product is placed on the market or the specific service is provided. The first subparagraph shall not apply to microenterprises. CHAPTER VI Harmonised standards and technical specifications of products and services Article 15 Presumption of conformity 1. Products and services which are in conformity with harmonised standards or parts thereof the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the accessibility requirements of this Directive in so far as those standards or parts thereof cover those requirements. 2. The Commission shall, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, request one or more European standardisation organisations to draft harmonised standards for the product accessibility requirements set out in Annex I. The Commission shall submit the first such draft request to the relevant committee by 28 June 2021. 3. The Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing technical specifications that meet the accessibility requirements of this Directive where the following conditions have been fulfilled: (a) no reference to harmonised standards is published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012; and (b) either: (i) the Commission has requested one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a harmonised standard and there are undue delays in the standardisation procedure or the request has not been accepted by any European standardisation organisations; or (ii) the Commission can demonstrate that a technical specification respects the requirements laid down in Annex II of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, except for the requirement that the technical specifications should have been developed by a non-profit making organisation. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 27(2). 4. Products and services which are in conformity with the technical specifications or parts thereof shall be presumed to be in conformity with the accessibility requirements of this Directive in so far as those technical specifications or parts thereof cover those requirements. CHAPTER VII Conformity of products and CE marking Article 16 EU declaration of conformity of products 1. The EU declaration of conformity shall state that the fulfilment of the applicable accessibility requirements has been demonstrated. Where as an exception, Article 14 has been used, the EU declaration of conformity shall state which accessibility requirements are subject to that exception. 2. The EU declaration of conformity shall have the model structure set out in Annex III to Decision No 768/2008/EC. It shall contain the elements specified in Annex IV to this Directive and shall be continuously updated. The requirements concerning the technical documentation shall avoid imposing any undue burden for microenterprises and SMEs. It shall be translated into the language or languages required by the Member State in which the product is placed or made available on the market. 3. Where a product is subject to more than one Union act requiring an EU declaration of conformity, a single EU declaration of conformity shall be drawn up in respect of all such Union acts. That declaration shall contain the identification of the acts concerned including the publication references. 4. By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the manufacturer shall assume responsibility for the compliance of the product with the requirements of this Directive. Article 17 General principles of the CE marking of products The CE marking shall be subject to the general principles set out in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Article 18 Rules and conditions for affixing the CE marking 1. The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the product or to its data plate. Where that is not possible, or not warranted, on account of the nature of the product, it shall be affixed to the packaging and to the accompanying documents. 2. The CE marking shall be affixed before the product is placed on the market. 3. Member States shall build upon existing mechanisms to ensure correct application of the regime governing the CE marking and shall take appropriate action in the event of improper use of that marking. CHAPTER VIII Market surveillance of products and Union safeguard procedure Article 19 Market surveillance of products 1. Article 15(3), Articles 16 to 19, Article 21, Articles 23 to 28 and Article 29(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to products. 2. When carrying out market surveillance of products, the relevant market surveillance authorities shall, when the economic operator has relied on Article 14 of this Directive: (a) check that the assessment referred to in Article 14 has been conducted by the economic operator; (b) review that assessment and its results, including the correct use of the criteria set out in Annex VI; and (c) check compliance with the applicable accessibility requirements. 3. Member States shall ensure that information held by market surveillance authorities concerning the compliance of economic operators with the applicable accessibility requirements of this Directive and the assessment provided for in Article 14, is made available to consumers upon request and in an accessible format, except where that information cannot be provided for reasons of confidentiality as provided for in Article 19(5) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Article 20 Procedure at national level for dealing with products not complying with the applicable accessibility requirements 1. Where the market surveillance authorities of one Member State have sufficient reason to believe that a product covered by this Directive does not comply with the applicable accessibility requirements, they shall carry out an evaluation in relation to the product concerned covering all requirements laid down in this Directive. The relevant economic operators shall fully cooperate with the market surveillance authorities for that purpose. Where, in the course of the evaluation referred to in the first subparagraph, the market surveillance authorities find that the product does not comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, they shall without delay require the relevant economic operator to take all appropriate corrective action to bring the product into compliance with those requirements within a reasonable period, commensurate with the nature of the non-compliance, as they may prescribe. Market surveillance authorities shall require the relevant economic operator to withdraw the product from the market, within an additional reasonable period, only if the relevant economic operator has failed to take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the second subparagraph. Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 shall apply to the measures referred to in the second and third subparagraphs of this paragraph. 2. Where the market surveillance authorities consider that non-compliance is not restricted to their national territory, they shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which they have required the economic operator to take. 3. The economic operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the products concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union. 4. Where the relevant economic operator does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 1, the market surveillance authorities shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the products being made available on their national markets or to withdraw the product from that market. The market surveillance authorities shall inform the Commission and the other Member States, without delay, of those measures. 5. The information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4 shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the non-compliant product, the origin of the product, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the accessibility requirements with which the product does not comply, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put forward by the relevant economic operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall indicate whether the non-compliance is due to either: (a) the failure of the product to meet the applicable accessibility requirements; or (b) the shortcomings in the harmonised standards or in the technical specifications referred to in Article 15 conferring a presumption of conformity. 6. Member States other than the Member State initiating the procedure under this Article shall without delay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the product concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of their objections. 7. Where, within three months of receipt of the information referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, no objection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. 8. Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures, such as withdrawal of the product from their market, are taken in respect of the product concerned without delay. Article 21 Union safeguard procedure 1. Where, on completion of the procedure set out in Article 20(3) and (4), objections are raised against a measure taken by a Member State, or where the Commission has reasonable evidence to suggest that a national measure is contrary to Union law, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation with the Member States and the relevant economic operator or operators and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide whether the national measure is justified or not. The Commission shall address its decision to all Member States and shall immediately communicate it to them and the relevant economic operator or operators. 2. Where the national measure referred to in paragraph 1 is considered justified, all Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the non-compliant product is withdrawn from their market, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. Where the national measure is considered unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure. 3. Where the national measure referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in point (b) of Article 20(5), the Commission shall apply the procedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. 4. Where the national measure referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is considered justified and the non-compliance of the product is attributed to shortcomings in the technical specifications referred to in point (b) of Article 20(5), the Commission shall, without delay, adopt implementing acts amending or repealing the technical specification concerned. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 27(2). Article 22 Formal non-compliance 1. Without prejudice to Article 20, where a Member State makes one of the following findings, it shall require the relevant economic operator to put an end to the non-compliance concerned: (a) the CE marking has been affixed in violation of Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 or of Article 18 of this Directive; (b) the CE marking has not been affixed; (c) the EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up; (d) the EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up correctly; (e) technical documentation is either not available or not complete; (f) the information referred to in Article 7(6) or Article 9(4) is absent, false or incomplete; (g) any other administrative requirement provided for in Article 7 or Article 9 is not fulfilled. 2. Where the non-compliance referred to in paragraph 1 persists, the Member State concerned shall take all appropriate measures to restrict or prohibit the product being made available on the market or to ensure that it is withdrawn from the market. CHAPTER IX Compliance of services Article 23 Compliance of services 1. Member States shall establish, implement and periodically update adequate procedures in order to: (a) check the compliance of services with the requirements of this Directive, including the assessment referred to in Article 14 for which Article 19(2) shall apply mutatis mutandis; (b) follow up complaints or reports on issues relating to non-compliance of services with the accessibility requirements of this Directive; (c) verify that the economic operator has taken the necessary corrective action. 2. Member States shall designate the authorities responsible for the implementation of the procedures referred to in paragraph 1 with respect to the compliance of services. Member States shall ensure that the public is informed of the existence, responsibilities, identity, work and decisions of the authorities referred to in the first subparagraph. Those authorities shall make that information available in accessible formats upon request. CHAPTER X Accessibility requirements in other Union acts Article 24 Accessibility under other Union acts 1. As regards the products and services referred to in Article 2 of this Directive, the accessibility requirements set out in Annex I thereto shall constitute mandatory accessibility requirements within the meaning of Article 42(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU and of Article 60(1) of Directive 2014/25/EU. 2. Any product or service, the features, elements or functions of which comply with the accessibility requirements set out in Annex I to this Directive in accordance with Section VI thereof shall be presumed to fulfil the relevant obligations set out in Union acts other than this Directive, as regards accessibility, for those features, elements or functions, unless otherwise provided in those other acts. Article 25 Harmonised standards and technical specifications for other Union acts Conformity with harmonised standards and technical specifications or parts thereof which are adopted in accordance with Article 15, shall create a presumption of compliance with Article 24 in so far as those standards and technical specifications or parts thereof meet the accessibility requirements of this Directive.

This can be achieved through compliance with international conventions, codes and resolutions while maintaining the freedom of navigation as provided for by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). (2) The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 calls attention to the threats of marine and nutrient pollution, resource depletion and climate change, all of which are caused primarily by human actions. Those threats place further pressure on environmental systems, like biodiversity and natural infrastructure, while creating global socioeconomic problems, including health, safety and financial risks. The Union must work to protect marine species and to support the people who depend on oceans, whether it be for employment, resources or leisure. (3) The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL Convention) provides for general prohibitions on discharges from ships at sea, but also regulates the conditions under which certain types of waste can be discharged into the marine environment. The MARPOL Convention requires contracting Parties to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities in ports. (4) The Union has pursued the implementation of parts of the MARPOL Convention through Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (4), by following a port-based approach. Directive 2000/59/EC aims to reconcile the interests of smooth operation of maritime transport with the protection of the marine environment. (5) In the last two decades, the MARPOL Convention and its Annexes have been the object of important amendments, which have put in place stricter norms and prohibitions for the discharges of waste from ships at sea. (6) Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention introduced discharge norms for new waste categories, in particular the residues from exhaust gas cleaning systems, consisting of both sludge and bleed-off water. Those waste categories should be included in the scope of this Directive. (7) Member States should continue to work at International Maritime Organization (IMO) level for a comprehensive consideration of the environmental impacts of wastewater discharges from open loop scrubbers, including for measures to counter possible impacts. (8) Member States should be encouraged to take appropriate measures in accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), including discharge bans for wastewater from open loop scrubbers and certain cargo residues in their territorial waters. (9) On 1 March 2018, the IMO adopted the revised Consolidated Guidance for port reception facility providers and users (MEPC.1/Circ. 834/Rev.1) (the IMO Consolidated Guidance), which includes standard formats for waste notification, for the waste delivery receipt and for reporting alleged inadequacies of port reception facilities, as well as waste reception facility reporting requirements. (10) Despite those regulatory developments, discharges of waste at sea still occur at substantial environmental, social and economic costs. This is due to a combination of factors, namely adequate port reception facilities not always being available in ports, enforcement often being insufficient and there being a lack of incentives to deliver the waste onshore. (11) Directive 2000/59/EC has contributed to increasing the volumes of waste being delivered to port reception facilities, inter alia, by ensuring that ships contribute to the costs of those facilities, irrespective of their actual use of those facilities, and as such has been instrumental in reducing waste discharges at sea, as was revealed in the evaluation of that Directive carried out in the framework of the Regulatory Fitness and Performance programme (REFIT Evaluation). (12) The REFIT Evaluation has also demonstrated that Directive 2000/59/EC has not been fully effective due to inconsistencies with the MARPOL Convention framework. In addition, Member States have developed different interpretations of the key concepts in that Directive, such as adequacy of the facilities, advance waste notification, the mandatory delivery of waste to port reception facilities and exemptions for ships in scheduled traffic. The REFIT Evaluation called for more harmonisation of those concepts and full alignment with the MARPOL Convention in order to avoid unnecessary administrative burden on both ports and port users. (13) In order to align Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) to the relevant MARPOL Convention provisions on discharge norms, the Commission should assess the desirability of a review of that Directive, in particular through an extension of its scope. (14) Union maritime policy should aim at a high level of protection of the marine environment taking into account the diversity of the maritime areas of the Union. It should be based on the principles that preventive action should be taken and that damage to the marine environment should, as a priority, be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay. (15) This Directive should be instrumental for the application of the main environmental legislation and principles in the context of ports and the management of waste from ships. In particular, Directives 2008/56/EC (7) and 2008/98/EC (8) of the European Parliament and the Council are relevant instruments in this regard. (16) Directive 2008/98/EC lays down the main waste management principles, including the polluter pays principle and the waste hierarchy, which calls for the reuse and recycling of waste over other forms of waste recovery and disposal and requires the establishment of systems for the separate collection of waste. In addition, the extended producer responsibility concept is a guiding principle of Union waste law, on the basis of which producers are responsible for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the life-cycle of those products. Those obligations also apply to the management of waste from ships. (17) Separate collection of waste from ships, including derelict fishing gear, is necessary to ensure its further recovery to enable it to be prepared for reuse or recycling in the downstream waste management chain and to prevent it from causing damage to marine wildlife and environments. Waste is often segregated on-board ships in accordance with international norms and standards, and Union law should ensure that these efforts of on-board waste segregation are not undermined by a lack of arrangements for separate collection on shore. (18) Every year a substantial amount of plastic enters the seas and oceans in the Union. Although, in most sea areas, the majority of marine litter originates from land-based activities, the shipping industry, including the fishing and recreational sectors, is also an important contributor, with discharges of waste, including plastic and derelict fishing gear, going directly into the sea. (19) Directive 2008/98/EC calls on Member States to halt the generation of marine litter as a contribution towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds. (20) The Commission Communication of 2 December 2015 entitled Closing the loop  An EU action plan for the Circular Economy acknowledged the specific role Directive 2000/59/EC had to play in this respect, by ensuring the availability of adequate facilities for the reception of waste, and providing for both the right level of incentives and the enforcement of the delivery of waste to the on-shore facilities. (21) Offshore installations are one of the sea-based sources of marine litter. For that reason, Member States should adopt measures as appropriate on waste delivery from offshore installations flying their flag or operating in their waters, or both, and ensure compliance with the stringent discharge norms applicable to offshore installations laid down in the MARPOL Convention. (22) Waste, in particular plastic waste, from rivers is one of the main contributors to marine litter, which includes discharges from inland waterway vessels. Those vessels should therefore be subject to stringent discharge and delivery norms. Nowadays, those rules are laid down by the relevant River Commission. However, inland ports are covered by Union waste law. To continue the efforts of harmonising the legislative framework for Union inland waterways, the Commission is invited to evaluate a Union regime for discharge and delivery norms of inland waterway vessels, taking into account the Convention on the collection, deposit and reception of waste produced during navigation on the Rhine and inland waterways of 9 September 1996 (CDNI). (23) Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (9) requires Union fishing vessels to have the equipment on board to retrieve lost gear. In cases where gear is lost, the master of the vessel is to attempt to retrieve it as soon as possible. If the lost gear cannot be retrieved, the master of the fishing vessel is to inform the authorities of its flag Member State within 24 hours. The flag Member State has then to inform the competent authority of the coastal Member State. The information includes the external identification number and the name of the fishing vessel, the type and the position of lost gear as well as the measures that were undertaken to retrieve it. Fishing vessels below 12 metres can be exempted. Under the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, the reporting by the fishing vessel is to be done in an electronic logbook, and Member States are required to collect and record the information concerning lost gear and provide it to the Commission upon request. The information collected and available in the waste delivery receipts on passively fished waste in line with this Directive could also be reported in this way. (24) In accordance with the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments, which was adopted on 13 February 2004 by IMO and which entered into force on 8 September 2017, all ships are obliged to carry out ballast water management procedures according to IMO standards, and ports and terminals designated for the cleaning and repair of ballast water tanks are required to provide adequate facilities for the reception of sediments. (25) A port reception facility is considered to be adequate if it is able to meet the needs of the ships normally using the port without causing undue delay, as also specified in the IMO Consolidated Guidance and the IMO Guidelines for ensuring the adequacy of port waste reception facilities (Resolution MEPC.83(44)). Adequacy relates both to the operational conditions of the facility in view of the user needs, as well as to the environmental management of the facilities in accordance with Union waste law. It might, in some cases, be difficult to assess whether a port reception facility located outside the Union meets such standard. (26) Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) requires international catering waste to be incinerated or disposed of by burial in an authorised landfill, including waste from ships calling at Union ports which has potentially been in contact with animal by-products on board. In order for this requirement not to limit the preparation for reuse and recycling of waste from ships, efforts should be made in accordance with the IMO Consolidated Guidance in order to better segregate the waste so that potential contamination of waste, such as packaging waste, can be avoided. (27) As established in Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, in conjunction with Commission Regulation (EU) No 142/2011 (11), intra-Union voyages are not considered transport operating internationally and the catering waste from those voyages does not need to be incinerated. However, such intra-Union voyages are considered international voyages under international maritime legislation (the MARPOL Convention and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)). In order to ensure the coherence of Union law, the definitions from Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 should be followed when defining the scope and treatment of international catering waste under this Directive, in conjunction with Regulation (EU) No 142/2011. (28) To ensure the adequacy of port reception facilities, the development, implementation and re-assessment of the waste reception and handling plan is essential, based on the consultation of all relevant parties. For practical and organisational reasons, neighbouring ports in the same geographical region might want to develop a joint plan, covering the availability of port reception facilities in each of the ports covered by that plan while providing a common administrative framework. (29) It can be challenging to adopt and monitor waste reception and handling plans for small non-commercial ports, such as mooring areas and marinas, which receive low traffic, consisting of recreational craft only, or which are only in use during part of the year. The waste from those small ports is normally handled by the municipal waste management system in accordance with the principles set out in Directive 2008/98/EC. In order not to overburden the local authorities and facilitate the waste management in such small ports, it should be sufficient that waste from such ports is included in the municipal waste stream and managed accordingly, that the port makes information regarding waste reception available to port users, and that the exempted ports are reported in an electronic system to allow for a minimum level of monitoring. (30) To address the problem of marine litter effectively, it is fundamental to provide the right level of incentives for the delivery of waste to port reception facilities, in particular waste as defined in Annex V to the MARPOL Convention (MARPOL Annex V waste). This can be achieved through a cost recovery system which requires the application of an indirect fee. That indirect fee should be due irrespective of the delivery of waste and should give the right of delivery of the waste without any additional direct charges. The fishing and recreational sector, given their contribution to the occurrence of marine litter, should also be subject to the indirect fee. However, where a ship delivers an exceptional amount of MARPOL Annex V waste, especially operational waste, which exceeds the maximum dedicated storage capacity as mentioned in the advance notification form for waste delivery, it should be possible for an additional direct fee to be charged in order to ensure that the costs related to receiving this exceptional amount of waste do not cause a disproportionate burden on a ports cost recovery system. This might also be the case where declared dedicated storage capacity is excessive or unreasonable. (31) In certain Member States, schemes have been set up to provide alternative financing of the costs of collecting and managing fishing gear waste or passively fished waste ashore, including fishing for litter schemes. Such initiatives should be welcomed, and Member States should be encouraged to complement the cost recovery systems set up in accordance with this Directive with the fishing for litter schemes to cover the costs of passively fished waste. As such, those cost recovery systems, which are based on the application of a 100 % indirect fee for MARPOL Annex V waste, excluding cargo residues, should not create a disincentive for fishing port communities to participate in existing delivery schemes for passively fished waste. (32) A ships fee should be reduced for those vessels designed, equipped or operated to minimise waste, following certain criteria to be developed by implementing powers conferred on the Commission, in line with the IMO guidelines for the implementation of MARPOL Annex V and with standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Reduction and efficient recycling of waste can be primarily achieved through effective on-board waste segregation in line with those guidelines and standards. (33) Due to its type of trade, which is characterised by frequent port calls, short sea shipping faces significant costs within the current regime for the delivery of waste to port reception facilities, having to pay a fee at each and every port call. At the same time, the traffic is not sufficiently scheduled and regular to qualify for an exemption from payment and delivery of waste on those grounds. To limit the financial burden on the sector, a reduced fee should be charged to vessels based on the type of traffic in which they are engaged. (34) Cargo residues remain the property of the cargo owner after unloading the cargo to the terminal, and may have an economic value. For this reason, cargo residues should not be included in the cost recovery systems and the application of the indirect fee. The charges for the delivery of cargo residues should be paid by the user of the port reception facility, as specified in the contractual arrangements between the parties involved or in other local arrangements. Cargo residues also include the remnants of oily or noxious liquid cargo after cleaning operations, to which the discharge norms of Annexes I and II to MARPOL Convention apply, and which under certain conditions, as set out in those Annexes, do not need to be delivered in port to avoid unnecessary operational costs for ships and congestion in ports. (35) Member States should encourage the delivery of residues from tank washings containing high-viscosity persistent floating substances, possibly by way of appropriate financial incentives. (36) Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12) includes the provision of port reception facilities as a service in its scope. It provides rules on the transparency of the charging structures applied for the use of port services, consultation of port users and handling of complaint procedures. This Directive goes beyond the framework provided by that Regulation by providing more detailed requirements for the design and operation of the cost recovery systems for port reception facilities for waste from ships and the transparency of the cost structure. (37) In addition to providing incentives for delivery of waste, effective enforcement of the delivery obligation is paramount and should follow a risk-based approach, for which a Union risk-based targeting mechanism should be established. (38) One of the main obstacles for the effective enforcement of the mandatory delivery obligation has been the different interpretation and implementation by Member States of the exception based on sufficient storage capacity. To avoid the application of this exception undermining the main objective of this Directive, it should be specified further, in particular with regard to the next port of call, and sufficient storage capacity should be determined in a harmonised way, based on common methodology and criteria. In cases where it is difficult to establish whether adequate port reception facilities in ports outside the Union are available, it is essential that the competent authority carefully considers the application of the exception. (39) There is a need for further harmonisation of the regime of exemptions for ships engaged in scheduled traffic with frequent and regular port calls, in particular clarification of the terms used and the conditions governing those exemptions. The REFIT Evaluation and the impact assessment have revealed that the lack of harmonisation of the conditions and application of exemptions has resulted in an unnecessary administrative burden for ships and ports. (40) Monitoring and enforcement should be facilitated through a system based on electronic reporting and exchange of information. To this end, the existing information and monitoring system set up under Directive 2000/59/EC should be further developed and should continue to be operated on basis of existing electronic data systems, in particular the Union Maritime Information and Exchange system (SafeSeaNet) established by Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) and the Inspection Database set up by Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) (THETIS). Such a system should also include the information on port reception facilities available in the different ports. (41) Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) simplifies and harmonises administrative procedures applied to maritime transport by making the electronic transmission of information more general and streamlining reporting formalities. The Valletta Declaration on the priorities for the EUs maritime transport policy until 2020, endorsed by the Council in its conclusions of 8 June 2017, invited the Commission to propose appropriate follow-up to the revision of that Directive. A public consultation on the reporting formalities for ships was carried out by the Commission from 25 October 2017 to 18 January 2018. On 17 May 2018, the Commission transmitted to the European Parliament and to the Council a proposal for a Regulation establishing a European Maritime Single Window environment and repealing Directive 2010/65/EU. (42) The MARPOL Convention requires the contracting Parties to maintain up-to-date information on their port reception facilities and to communicate this information to the IMO. To this end, the IMO has established a port reception facilities database within its Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS). (43) In the IMO Consolidated Guidance, the IMO provides for the reporting of alleged inadequacies of port reception facilities. Under that procedure, a ship should report such inadequacies to the administration of the flag State, which in turn is to notify the IMO and the port State of the occurrence. The port State should examine the report and respond appropriately, informing the IMO and the reporting flag State. Reporting of this information on alleged inadequacies directly into the information, monitoring and enforcement system provided for in this Directive would allow for the subsequent transmission of this information into GISIS, relieving Member States as flag and port States from their reporting duty to the IMO. (44) The Sub-group on Port Reception Facilities, which was set up under the European Sustainable Shipping Forum, and which brought together a wide range of experts in the field of ship-source pollution and the management of waste from ships, was adjourned in December 2017 in view of the start of interinstitutional negotiations. Since that Sub-group provided valuable guidance and expertise to the Commission, it would be desirable to create a similar expert group with a mandate of exchanging experience on the implementation of this Directive. (45) It is important that any penalties laid down by Member States be properly implemented and be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. (46) Good working conditions for port personnel working in port reception facilities are of paramount importance to creating a safe, efficient and socially accountable maritime sector, which is able to attract qualified workers and ensure a wide-level playing field across Europe. Initial and periodic training of staff is essential to ensure the quality of services and the protection of workers. Port authorities and port reception facility authorities should ensure that all personnel receive the necessary training to acquire the knowledge which is essential for their work, with specific attention for health and safety aspects pertaining to dealing with hazardous materials, and that training requirements are regularly updated to meet the challenges of technological innovation. (47) The powers conferred on the Commission to implement Directive 2000/59/EC should be updated in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). (48) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the Annexes to this Directive and the references to international instruments to the extent necessary to bring them into line with Union law or in order to take account of developments at international level, in particular at IMO level; amending the Annexes to this Directive when this is necessary in order to improve the implementation and monitoring arrangements established by it, in particular in relation to the effective notification and delivery of waste, and the proper application of exemptions; as well as, in exceptional circumstances, where duly justified by an appropriate analysis by the Commission and in order to avoid a serious and unacceptable threat to the marine environment, amending this Directive to the extent necessary to avoid such a threat, in order to prevent, if necessary, changes to those international instruments from applying for the purposes of this Directive. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (16). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (49) In order to provide for the methods for the calculation of the sufficient dedicated storage capacity; to develop common criteria for recognising, for the purpose of granting a reduced waste fee to ships, that a ships design, equipment and operation demonstrate that it produces reduced quantities of waste, and manages its waste in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner; to define methodologies for monitoring data on the volume and quantity of passively fished waste and the format for reporting; to define the detailed elements of a Union risk-based targeting mechanism, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council (17). (50) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the protection of the marine environment from discharges of waste at sea, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (51) The Union is characterised by regional differences at port level, as also demonstrated in the territorial impact assessment carried out by the Commission. Ports differ based on geographic location, size, administrative set-up and ownership, and are characterised by the type of ships that normally visit. In addition, waste management systems reflect the differences at municipal level and downstream waste management infrastructure. (52) Article 349 TFEU requires consideration to be given to the special characteristics of the outermost regions of the Union, namely Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte, RÃ ©union, Saint-Martin, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. To ensure the adequacy and availability of port reception facilities, it might be appropriate for Member States to make regional operating aid available to port reception facility operators or port authorities in those regions of the Union in order to address the effects of the permanent handicaps referred to in that Article. Regional operating aid made available by Member States in that context is exempt from the notification obligation laid down in Article 108(3) TFEU if, at the time it is granted, it fulfils the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014 (18), adopted pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 (19). (53) Directive 2000/59/EC should therefore be repealed, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Section 1 General provisions Article 1 Subject matter This Directive aims to protect the marine environment against the negative effects from discharges of waste from ships using ports located in the Union, while ensuring the smooth operation of maritime traffic, by improving the availability and use of adequate port reception facilities and the delivery of waste to those facilities. Article 2 Definitions For the purpose of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (1) ship means a seagoing vessel of any type operating in the marine environment, including fishing vessels, recreational craft, hydrofoil boats, air-cushion vehicles, submersibles and floating craft; (2) MARPOL Convention means the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, in its up-to-date version; (3) waste from ships means all waste, including cargo residues, which is generated during the service of a ship or during loading, unloading and cleaning operations and which falls within the scope of Annexes I, II, IV, V and VI to MARPOL Convention, as well as passively fished waste; (4) passively fished waste means waste collected in nets during fishing operations; (5) cargo residues means the remnants of any cargo material on board which remain on the deck or in holds or tanks following loading and unloading, including loading and unloading excess or spillage, whether in wet or dry condition or entrained in wash-water, excluding cargo dust remaining on the deck after sweeping or dust of the external surfaces of the ship; (6) port reception facility means any facility which is fixed, floating or mobile and capable of providing the service of receiving the waste from ships; (7) fishing vessel means any ship equipped or used commercially for catching fish or other living resources from the sea; (8) recreational craft means a ship of any type, with a hull length of 2,5 metres or more, regardless of the means of propulsion, intended for sports or leisure purposes, and not engaged in trade; (9) port means a place or a geographical area made up of such improvement works and equipment designed principally to permit the reception of ships, including the anchorage area within the jurisdiction of the port; (10) sufficient storage capacity means enough capacity to store the waste on board from the moment of departure until the next port of call, including the waste that is likely to be generated during the voyage; (11) scheduled traffic means traffic based on a published or planned list of times of departures and arrivals between identified ports or recurrent crossings that constitute a recognised schedule; (12) regular port calls means repeated voyages of the same ship forming a constant pattern between identified ports or a series of voyages from and to the same port without intermediate calls; (13) frequent port calls means visits by a ship to the same port taking place at least once a fortnight; (14) GISIS means the Global Integrated Shipping Information System set up by the IMO; (15) treatment means recovery or disposal operations, including preparation prior to recovery or disposal; (16) indirect fee means a fee paid for the provision of port reception facility services, irrespective of the actual delivery of waste from ships. Waste from ships referred to in point (3) shall be considered to be waste within the meaning of point 1 of Article 3 of Directive 2008/98/EC. Article 3 Scope 1. This Directive applies to: (a) all ships, irrespective of their flag, calling at, or operating within, a port of a Member State, with the exception of ships engaged in port services within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/352, and with the exception of any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on a government non-commercial basis; (b) all ports of the Member States normally visited by ships falling within the scope of point (a). For the purpose of this Directive, and to avoid undue delay to ships, Member States may decide to exclude the anchorage area from their ports for the purposes of the application of Article s 6, 7 and 8. 2. Member States shall take measures to ensure that, where reasonably possible, ships which do not fall within the scope of this Directive deliver their waste in a manner consistent with this Directive. 3. Member States which have neither ports nor ships flying their flag that fall within the scope of this Directive may, with the exception of the obligation set out in the third subparagraph of this paragraph, derogate from the provisions of this Directive. Member States which do not have ports that fall within the scope of this Directive may derogate from the provisions of this Directive which are addressed solely to ports. Those Member States which intend to avail themselves of the derogations set out in this paragraph shall communicate to the Commission by 28 June 2021 whether the relevant conditions have been met and shall inform the Commission annually thereafter of any subsequent change. Until such Member States have transposed and implemented this Directive, they may not have any ports falling within the scope of this Directive and they may not allow ships, including craft, that fall within the scope of this Directive to fly their flag. Section 2 Provision of adequate port reception facilities Article 4 Port reception facilities 1. Member States shall ensure the availability of port reception facilities adequate to meet the need of the ships normally using the port without causing undue delay to ships. 2. Member States shall ensure that: (a) the port reception facilities have the capacity to receive the types and quantities of waste from ships normally using that port, taking into account: (i) the operational needs of the port users; (ii) the size and geographical location of that port; (iii) the type of ships calling at that port; and (iv) the exemptions provided for under Article 9; (b) the formalities and practical arrangements relating to the use of the port reception facilities are simple and expeditious to avoid undue delays to ships; (c) the fees charged for delivery do not create a disincentive for ships to use the port reception facilities; and (d) the port reception facilities allow for the management of the waste from ships in an environmentally sound manner in accordance with Directive 2008/98/EC and other relevant Union and national waste law. For the purposes of point (d) of the first subparagraph, the Member States shall ensure separate collection to facilitate reuse and recycling of waste from ships in ports as required under Union waste law, in particular Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (20), Directive 2008/98/EC and Directive 2012/19/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (21). In order to facilitate this process, port reception facilities may collect the separate waste fractions in accordance with waste categories defined in the MARPOL Convention, taking into account the guidelines thereof. Point (d) of the first subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to the more stringent requirements imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 for the management of catering waste from international transport. 3. Member States, in their capacity as flag States, shall use the IMO forms and procedures to notify the IMO as well as the authorities of the port State of alleged inadequacies of port reception facilities. Member States, in their capacity as port States, shall investigate all reported cases of alleged inadequacies and use the IMO forms and procedures to notify the IMO and the reporting flag State of the outcome of the investigation. 4. The port authorities concerned or, failing them, the relevant authorities shall ensure that waste delivery or reception operations are carried out with sufficient safety measures to avert risks to persons and the environment at ports covered by this Directive. 5. Member States shall ensure that any party involved in the delivery or reception of waste from ships can claim compensation for damage caused by undue delay. Article 5 Waste reception and handling plans 1. Member States shall ensure that an appropriate waste reception and handling plan is in place and has been implemented for each port following ongoing consultations with the relevant parties, including in particular with port users or their representatives, and, where appropriate, local competent authorities, port reception facility operators, organisations implementing extended producer responsibility obligations and representatives of civil society. Those consultations should be held both during the initial drafting of the waste reception and handling plan and after its adoption, in particular when significant changes have taken place, with regard to the requirements in Article s 4, 6 and 7. The detailed requirements for the development of the waste reception and handling plan are set out in Annex 1. 2. Member States shall ensure that the following information from the waste reception and handling plan on the availability of adequate port reception facilities in their ports and the structure of the costs is clearly communicated to the ship operators, is made publicly available and is easily accessible, in an official language of the Member State where the port is located and, where relevant, in a language that is internationally used: (a) location of port reception facilities applicable to each berth, and, where relevant, their opening hours; (b) list of waste from ships normally managed by the port; (c) list of contact points, the port reception facility operators and the services offered; (d) description of the procedures for delivery of the waste; (e) description of the cost recovery system, including waste management schemes and funds as referred to in Annex 4, where applicable. The information referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall also be made available electronically and kept up-to-date in that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13. 3. Where required for reasons of efficiency, the waste reception and handling plans may be developed jointly by two or more neighbouring ports in the same geographical region, with the appropriate involvement of each port, provided that the need for and availability of port reception facilities are specified for each port. 4. Member States shall evaluate and approve the waste reception and handling plan and ensure its re-approval at least every five years after it has been approved or re-approved, and after significant changes in the operation of the port have taken place. Those changes may include structural changes in traffic to the port, development of new infrastructure, changes in the demand and provision of port reception facilities, and new on-board treatment techniques. Member States shall monitor the ports implementation of the waste reception and handling plan. Where, during the five-year period referred to in the first subparagraph, no significant changes have taken place, the re-approval may consist of a validation of existing plans. 5. Small non-commercial ports which are characterised by rare or low traffic from recreational craft only may be exempted from paragraphs 1 to 4 if their port reception facilities are integrated in the waste handling system managed by or on behalf of the relevant municipality and the Member States where those ports are located ensure that the information regarding the waste management system is made available to the users of those ports. The Member States where such ports are located shall notify the name and location of those ports electronically in that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13. Section 3 Delivery of waste from ships Article 6 Advance waste notification 1. The operator, agent or master of a ship which falls within the scope of Directive 2002/59/EC bound for a Union port shall complete truly and accurately the form set out in Annex 2 to this Directive (advance waste notification) and notify all the information contained therein to the authority or body designated for this purpose by the Member State in which that port is located: (a) at least 24 hours prior to arrival, if the port of call is known; (b) as soon as the port of call is known, if this information is available less than 24 hours prior to arrival; or (c) at the latest upon departure from the previous port, if the duration of the voyage is less than 24 hours. 2. The information from the advance waste notification shall be reported electronically in that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13 of this Directive, in accordance with Directives 2002/59/EC and 2010/65/EU. 3. The information from the advance waste notification shall be available on board, preferably in electronic form, at least until the next port of call and shall be made available upon request to the relevant Member States authorities. 4. Member States shall ensure that the information that is notified pursuant to this Article is examined and shared with the relevant enforcement authorities without delay. Article 7 Delivery of waste from ships 1. The master of a ship calling at a Union port shall, before leaving that port, deliver all its waste carried on board to a port reception facility in accordance with the relevant discharge norms laid down in the MARPOL Convention. 2. Upon delivery, the port reception facility operator or the authority of the port where the waste was delivered shall truly and accurately complete the form set out in Annex 3 (waste delivery receipt) and issue and provide, without undue delay, the waste delivery receipt to the master of the ship. The requirements set out in the first subparagraph shall not apply in small ports with unmanned facilities or that are remotely located, provided that the Member State where such ports are located has notified the name and location of those ports electronically in that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13. 3. The operator, agent or master of a ship which falls within the scope of Directive 2002/59/EC shall before departure, or as soon as the waste delivery receipt has been received, electronically report the information contained therein in that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13 of this Directive, in accordance with Directives 2002/59/EC and 2010/65/EU. The information from the waste delivery receipt shall be available on board for at least two years, where relevant with the appropriate Oil Record Book, Cargo Record Book, Garbage Record Book or the Garbage Management Plan, and shall be made available upon request to the Member States authorities. 4. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, a ship may proceed to the next port of call without delivering the waste, if: (a) the information provided in accordance with Annexes 2 and 3 shows that there is sufficient dedicated storage capacity for all waste that has been accumulated and will be accumulated during the intended voyage of the ship until the next port of call; (b) the information available on board ships falling outside the scope of Directive 2002/59/EC shows that there is sufficient dedicated storage capacity for all waste that has been accumulated and will be accumulated during the intended voyage of the ship until the next port of call; or (c) the ship only calls at anchorage for less than 24 hours or under adverse weather conditions, unless such an area has been excluded in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 3(1). In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the exception referred to in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to define the methods to be used for the calculation of the sufficient dedicated storage capacity. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 20(2). 5. A Member State shall require the ship to deliver, before departure, all its waste if: (a) it cannot be established, based on the available information, including information electronically available in that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13 or in GISIS, that adequate port reception facilities are available in the next port of call; or (b) the next port of call is unknown. 6. Paragraph 4 shall apply without prejudice to more stringent requirements for ships adopted in accordance with international law. Article 8 Cost recovery systems 1. Member States shall ensure that the costs of operating port reception facilities for the reception and treatment of waste from ships, other than cargo residues, are covered through the collection of a fee from ships. Those costs include the elements listed in Annex 4. 2. The cost recovery systems shall provide no incentive for ships to discharge their waste at sea. To this end, the Member States shall apply all of the following principles in the design and operation of the cost recovery systems: (a) ships shall pay an indirect fee, irrespective of delivery of waste to a port reception facility; (b) the indirect fee shall cover: (i) the indirect administrative costs; (ii) a significant part of the direct operational costs, as determined in Annex 4, which shall represent at least 30 % of the total direct costs for actual delivery of the waste during the previous year, with the possibility of also taking into account costs related to the traffic volume expected for the coming year; (c) in order to provide for a maximum incentive for the delivery of MARPOL Annex V waste other than cargo residues, no direct fee shall be charged for such waste, in order to ensure a right of delivery without any additional charges based on the volume of waste delivered, except where the volume of waste delivered exceeds the maximum dedicated storage capacity mentioned in the form set out in Annex 2 to this Directive; passively fished waste shall be covered by this regime, including the right of delivery; (d) in order to avoid that the costs of collection and treatment of passively fished waste are borne exclusively by port users, Member States shall cover, where appropriate, those costs from the revenues generated by alternative financing systems, including by waste management schemes and by Union, national or regional funding available; (e) in order to encourage the delivery of residues from tank washing containing high-viscosity persistent floating substances, Member States may provide for appropriate financial incentives for their delivery; (f) the indirect fee shall not include the waste from exhaust gas cleaning systems, the costs of which shall be covered on the basis of the types and quantities of waste delivered. 3. The part of the costs which is not covered by the indirect fee, if any, shall be covered on the basis of the types and quantities of waste actually delivered by the ship. 4. The fees may be differentiated on the following basis: (a) the category, type and size of the ship; (b) the provision of services to ships outside normal operating hours in the port; or (c) the hazardous nature of the waste. 5. The fees shall be reduced on the following basis: (a) the type of trade the ship is engaged in, in particular when a ship is engaged in short sea shipping trade; (b) the ships design, equipment and operation demonstrate that the ship produces reduced quantities of waste, and manages its waste in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner. By 28 June 2020, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to define the criteria for determining that a ship meets the requirements stated in point (b) of the first subparagraph in relation to the ships on-board waste management. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 20(2). 6. In order to ensure that the fees are fair, transparent, easily identifiable, non-discriminatory, and that they reflect the costs of the facilities and services made available, and, where appropriate, used, the amount of the fees and the basis on which they have been calculated shall be made available in an official language of the Member State where the port is located and, where relevant, in a language that is internationally used to the port users in the waste reception and handling plan. 7. Member States shall ensure that monitoring data on the volume and quantity of passively fished waste are collected, and shall report such monitoring data to the Commission. The Commission shall, on the basis of those monitoring data, publish a report by 31 December 2022 and every two years thereafter. The Commission shall adopt implementing acts to define monitoring data methodologies and the format for reporting. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 20(2). Article 9 Exemptions 1. Member States may exempt a ship calling at their ports from the obligations in Article 6, Article 7(1) and Article 8 (the exemption), where there is sufficient evidence that the following conditions are met: (a) the ship is engaged in scheduled traffic with frequent and regular port calls; (b) there is an arrangement to ensure the delivery of the waste and payment of the fees in a port along the ships route which: (i) is evidenced by a signed contract with a port or waste contractor and by waste delivery receipts; (ii) has been notified to all ports on the ships route; and (iii) has been accepted by the port where the delivery and payment take place, which can be a Union port or another port in which, as established on the basis of the information reported electronically into that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13 and in GISIS, adequate facilities are available; (c) the exemption does not pose a negative impact on maritime safety, health, shipboard living or working conditions or on the marine environment. 2. If the exemption is granted, the Member State where the port is located shall issue an exemption certificate, based on the format set out in Annex 5, confirming that the ship meets the necessary conditions and requirements for the application of the exemption and stating the duration of the exemption. 3. Member States shall report the information from the exemption certificate electronically in that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13. 4. Member States shall ensure effective monitoring and enforcement of the arrangements for the delivery and payment in place for the exempted ships visiting their ports. 5. Notwithstanding the exemption granted, a ship shall not proceed to the next port of call if there is insufficient dedicated storage capacity for all waste that has been accumulated and that will be accumulated during the intended voyage of the ship until the next port of call. Section 4 Enforcement Article 10 Inspections Member States shall ensure that any ship may be subject to inspections, including random ones, in order to verify that it complies with this Directive. Article 11 Inspection commitments 1. Each Member State shall carry out inspections of ships calling in its ports corresponding to at least 15 % of the total number of individual ships calling in its ports annually. The total number of individual ships calling in a Member State shall be calculated as the average number of individual ships over the previous three years, as reported through that part of the information, monitoring and enforcement system referred to in Article 13. 2. Member States shall comply with paragraph 1 of this Article by selecting ships on the basis of a Union risk-based targeting mechanism. In order to ensure harmonisation of inspections and to provide for uniform conditions for selection of ships for inspection, the Commission shall adopt implementing acts to define the detailed elements of the Union risk-based targeting mechanism. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 20(2). 3. Member States shall establish procedures for inspections of ships that fall outside the scope of Directive 2002/59/EC in order to ensure, as far as practicable, compliance with this Directive. When establishing those procedures, Member States may take into account the Union risk-based targeting mechanism referred to in paragraph 2. 4. If the relevant authority of the Member State is not satisfied with the results of the inspection, it shall, without prejudice to the application of the penalties referred to in Article 16, ensure that the ship does not leave port until it has delivered its waste to a port reception facility in accordance with Article 7. Article 12 Information, monitoring and enforcement system The implementation and enforcement of this Directive shall be facilitated by the electronic reporting and exchange of information between Member States in accordance with Article s 13 and 14. Article 13 Reporting and exchange of information 1. The reporting and exchange of information shall be based on the Union Maritime Information and Exchange System (SafeSeaNet) referred to in Article 22a(3) of and Annex III to Directive 2002/59/EC. 2. Member States shall ensure that the following information is reported electronically and within reasonable time in accordance with Directive 2010/65/EU: (a) the information on the actual time of arrival and time of departure of every ship falling within the scope of Directive 2002/59/EC which calls at a Union port, together with an identifier of the port concerned; (b) the information from the advance waste notification, as set out in Annex 2; (c) the information from the waste delivery receipt, as set out in Annex 3; (d) the information from the exemption certificate, as set out in Annex 5. 3. Member States shall ensure that the information listed in Article 5(2) is made electronically available through SafeSeaNet. Article 14 Recording of inspections 1. The Commission shall develop, maintain and update an inspection database to which all Member States shall be connected and which shall contain all the information required for the implementation of the inspection system provided for by this Directive (the inspection database). The inspection database shall be based on the inspection database referred to in Article 24 of Directive 2009/16/EC and shall have similar functionalities to that database. 2. Member States shall ensure that the information related to inspections under this Directive, including information regarding non-compliance and prohibition of departure orders issued, is transferred without delay to the inspection database, as soon as: (a) the inspection report has been completed; (b) the prohibition of departure order has been lifted; or (c) an exemption has been granted. 3. The Commission shall ensure that the inspection database makes it possible to retrieve any relevant data reported by the Member States for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of this Directive. The Commission shall ensure that the inspection database provides information for the Union risk-based targeting mechanism referred to in Article 11(2). The Commission shall regularly review the inspection database to monitor the implementation of this Directive and call attention to any doubts regarding comprehensive implementation with the aim of instigating corrective action. 4. Member States shall at all times have access to the information recorded in the inspection database. Article 15 Training of personnel Port authorities and port reception facility authorities shall ensure that all personnel receive the necessary training to acquire the knowledge which is essential for their work on dealing with waste, with specific attention to health and safety aspects pertaining to dealing with hazardous materials, and that training requirements are regularly updated to meet the challenges of technological innovation.

It shall not affect the validity of any delegated acts already in force. 4. Before adopting a delegated act, the Commission shall consult experts designated by each Member State in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. 5. As soon as it adopts a delegated act, the Commission shall notify it simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the Council. 6. A delegated act adopted pursuant to Article 18(1), (2) and (3) shall enter into force only if no objection has been expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council within a period of two months of notification of that act to the European Parliament and the Council or if, before the expiry of that period, the European Parliament and the Council have both informed the Commission that they will not object. That period shall be extended by two months at the initiative of the European Parliament or of the Council. Article 20 Committee procedure 1.

The Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe tackles in a holistic manner the major obstacles to the development of cross-border e-commerce in the Union in order to unleash this potential. Ensuring better access for consumers to digital content and digital services, and making it easier for businesses to supply digital content and digital services, can contribute to boosting the Union's digital economy and stimulating overall growth. (2) Article 26(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that the Union is to adopt measures with the aim of establishing or ensuring the functioning of the internal market, which is to comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods and services is ensured. Article 169(1), and point (a) of Article 169(2), TFEU provide that the Union is to contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection through measures adopted pursuant to Article 114 TFEU in the context of the completion of the internal market. This Directive aims to strike the right balance between achieving a high level of consumer protection and promoting the competitiveness of enterprises, while ensuring respect for the principle of subsidiarity. (3) Certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content or digital services should be harmonised, taking as a base a high level of consumer protection, in order to achieve a genuine digital single market, increase legal certainty and reduce transaction costs, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). (4) Businesses, especially SMEs, often face additional costs, stemming from differences in national mandatory consumer contract law rules, and legal uncertainty when offering cross-border digital content or digital services. Businesses also face costs when adapting their contracts to specific mandatory rules for the supply of digital content or digital services, which are already being applied in several Member States, creating differences in scope and content between specific national rules governing such contracts. (5) Consumers are not always confident when buying cross border and especially when it is done online. One of the major factors for consumers' lack of confidence is uncertainty about their key contractual rights and the lack of a clear contractual framework for digital content or digital services. Many consumers experience problems related to the quality of, or access to, digital content or digital services. For instance, they receive wrong or faulty digital content or digital services, or they are not able to access the digital content or digital service in question. As a result, consumers suffer financial and non-financial detriment. (6) In order to remedy such problems, both businesses and consumers should be able to rely on fully harmonised contractual rights in certain core areas concerning the supply of digital content or digital services across the Union. Full harmonisation of some key regulatory aspects would considerably increase legal certainty for consumers and businesses. (7) Harmonised consumer contract law rules in all Member States would make it easier for businesses, especially SMEs, to supply digital content or digital services across the Union. They would provide businesses with a stable contract law environment when supplying digital content or digital services in other Member States. They would also prevent legal fragmentation that otherwise would arise from new national legislation regulating specifically digital content and digital services. (8) Consumers should benefit from harmonised rights for the supply of digital content and digital services that provide a high level of protection. They should have clear mandatory rights when they receive or access digital content or digital services from anywhere in the Union. Having such rights should increase their confidence in acquiring digital content or digital services. It should also contribute to reducing the detriment consumers currently suffer, since there would be a set of clear rights that will enable them to address problems they face with digital content or digital services. (9) This Directive should fully harmonise certain key rules that have, so far, not been regulated at Union or national level. (10) This Directive should define its scope in a clear and unequivocal manner and provide clear substantive rules for the digital content or digital services falling within its scope. Both the scope of this Directive and its substantive rules should be technologically neutral and future-proof. (11) This Directive should lay down common rules on certain requirements concerning contracts between traders and consumers for the supply of digital content or a digital service. For this purpose, rules on the conformity of digital content or a digital service with the contract, remedies in the event of a lack of such conformity or a failure to supply and the modalities for the exercise of those remedies, as well as on the modification of digital content or a digital service, should be fully harmonised. Fully harmonised rules on some essential elements of consumer contract law would make it easier for businesses, especially SMEs, to offer their products in other Member States. Consumers would benefit from a high level of consumer protection and welfare gains by fully harmonising key rules. Member States are precluded within the scope of this Directive from providing for any further formal or substantive requirements. For example, Member States should not provide for rules on the reversal of the burden of proof that are different from those provided for in this Directive, or for an obligation for the consumer to notify the trader of a lack of conformity within a specific period. (12) This Directive should not affect national law to the extent that the matters concerned are not regulated by this Directive, such as national rules on the formation, validity, nullity or effects of contracts or the legality of the digital content or the digital service. This Directive should also not determine the legal nature of contracts for the supply of digital content or a digital service, and the question of whether such contracts constitute, for instance, a sales, service, rental or sui generis contract, should be left to national law. This Directive should also not affect national rules that do not specifically concern consumer contracts and provide for specific remedies for certain types of defects that were not apparent at the time of conclusion of the contract, namely national provisions which may lay down specific rules for the trader's liability for hidden defects. This Directive should also not affect national laws providing for non-contractual remedies for the consumer, in the event of lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service, against persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, or other persons that fulfil the obligations of such persons. (13) Member States also remain free, for example, to regulate liability claims of a consumer against a third party other than a trader that supplies or undertakes to supply the digital content or digital service, such as a developer which is not at the same time the trader under this Directive. (14) Member States should also remain free, for example, to regulate the consequences of a failure to supply, or of a lack of conformity of, digital content or a digital service, where such failure to supply or lack of conformity is due to an impediment beyond the control of the trader and where the trader could not be expected to have avoided or overcome the impediment or its consequences, such as in the event of force majeure. (15) Member States should also remain free, for example, to regulate the rights of parties to withhold the performance of their obligations or part thereof until the other party performs its obligations. For example, Member States should be free to regulate whether a consumer, in cases of a lack of conformity, is to be entitled to withhold payment of the price or part thereof until the trader has brought the digital content or digital service into conformity, or whether the trader is to be entitled to retain any reimbursement due to the consumer upon termination of the contract until the consumer complies with the obligation provided for in this Directive to return the tangible medium to the trader. (16) Member States should also remain free to extend the application of the rules of this Directive to contracts that are excluded from the scope of this Directive, or to otherwise regulate such contracts. For instance, Member States should remain free to extend the protection afforded to consumers by this Directive also to natural or legal persons that are not consumers within the meaning of this Directive, such as non-governmental organisations, start-ups or SMEs. (17) The definition of a consumer should cover natural persons who are acting outside their trade, business, craft or profession. However, Member States should also remain free to determine, in the case of dual purpose contracts, where the contract is concluded for purposes that are partly within and partly outside the person's trade, and where the trade purpose is so limited as not to be predominant in the overall context of the contract, whether and under which conditions that person should also be considered a consumer. (18) This Directive should apply to any contract whereby the trader supplies or undertakes to supply digital content or digital service to the consumer. Platform providers could be considered to be traders under this Directive if they act for purposes relating to their own business and as the direct contractual partner of the consumer for the supply of digital content or a digital service. Member States should remain free to extend the application of this Directive to platform providers that do not fulfil the requirements for being considered a trader under this Directive. (19) The Directive should address problems across different categories of digital content, digital services, and their supply. In order to cater for fast technological developments and to maintain the future-proof nature of the notion of digital content or digital service, this Directive should cover, inter alia, computer programmes, applications, video files, audio files, music files, digital games, e-books or other e-publications, and also digital services which allow the creation of, processing of, accessing or storage of data in digital form, including software-as-a-service, such as video and audio sharing and other file hosting, word processing or games offered in the cloud computing environment and social media. As there are numerous ways for digital content or digital services to be supplied, such as transmission on a tangible medium, downloading by consumers on their devices, web-streaming, allowing access to storage capabilities of digital content or access to the use of social media, this Directive should apply independently of the medium used for the transmission of, or for giving access to, the digital content or digital service. However, this Directive should not apply to internet access services. (20) This Directive and Directive (EU) 2019/771 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) should complement each other. While this Directive lays down rules on certain requirements concerning contracts for the supply of digital content or digital services, Directive (EU) 2019/771 lays down rules on certain requirements concerning contracts for the sale of goods. Accordingly, in order to meet the expectations of consumers and ensure a clear-cut and simple legal framework for traders of digital content, this Directive should also apply to digital content which is supplied on a tangible medium, such as DVDs, CDs, USB sticks and memory cards, as well as to the tangible medium itself, provided that the tangible medium serves exclusively as a carrier of the digital content. However, instead of the provisions of this Directive on the trader's obligation to supply and on the consumer's remedies for failure to supply, the provisions of Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) on obligations related to the delivery of goods and remedies in the event of the failure to deliver should apply. In addition, the provisions of Directive 2011/83/EU on, for example, the right of withdrawal and the nature of the contract under which those goods are supplied, should also continue to apply to such tangible media and the digital content supplied on it. This Directive is also without prejudice to the distribution right applicable to these goods under copyright law. (21) Directive (EU) 2019/771 should apply to contracts for the sale of goods, including goods with digital elements. The notion of goods with digital elements should refer to goods that incorporate or are inter-connected with digital content or a digital service in such a way that the absence of that digital content or digital service would prevent the goods from performing their functions. Digital content or a digital service that is incorporated in or inter-connected with goods in that manner should fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2019/771 if it is provided with the goods under a sales contract concerning those goods. Whether the supply of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service forms part of the sales contract with the seller should depend on the content of this contract. This should include incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital services the supply of which is explicitly required by the contract. It should also include those sales contracts which can be understood as covering the supply of specific digital content or a specific digital service because they are normal for goods of the same type and the consumer could reasonably expect them given the nature of the goods and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of the seller or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, including the producer. If, for example, a smart TV were advertised as including a particular video application, that video application would be considered to be part of the sales contract. This should apply regardless of whether the digital content or digital service is pre-installed in the good itself or has to be downloaded subsequently on another device and is only inter-connected to the good. For example, a smart phone could come with a standardised pre-installed application provided under the sales contract, such as an alarm application or a camera application. Another possible example is that of a smart watch. In such a case, the watch itself would be considered to be the good with digital elements, which can perform its functions only with an application that is provided under the sales contract but has to be downloaded by the consumer onto a smart phone; the application would then be the inter-connected digital element. This should also apply if the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service is not supplied by the seller itself but is supplied, under the sales contract, by a third party. In order to avoid uncertainty for both traders and consumers, in the event of doubt as to whether the supply of the digital content or the digital service forms part of the sales contract, Directive (EU) 2019/771 should apply. Furthermore, ascertaining a bilateral contractual relationship, between the seller and the consumer, of which the supply of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service forms part should not be affected by the mere fact that the consumer has to consent to a licensing agreement with a third party in order to benefit from the digital content or the digital service. (22) In contrast, if the absence of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service does not prevent the goods from performing their functions, or if the consumer concludes a contract for the supply of digital content or a digital service which does not form part of a sales contract concerning goods with digital elements, that contract should be considered to be separate from the contract for the sale of the goods, even if the seller acts as an intermediary of that second contract with the third-party supplier, and could fall within the scope of this Directive. For instance, if the consumer downloads a game application from an app store onto a smart phone, the contract for the supply of the game application is separate from the contract for the sale of the smart phone itself. Directive (EU) 2019/771 should therefore only apply to the sales contract concerning the smart phone, while the supply of the game application could fall under this Directive, if the conditions of this Directive are met. Another example would be where it is expressly agreed that the consumer buys a smart phone without a specific operating system and the consumer subsequently concludes a contract for the supply of an operating system from a third party. In such a case, the supply of the separately bought operating system would not form part of the sales contract and therefore would not fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2019/771, but could fall within the scope of this Directive, if the conditions of this Directive are met. (23) Digital representations of value such as electronic vouchers or e-coupons are used by consumers to pay for different goods or services in the digital single market. Such digital representations of value are becoming important in relation to the supply of digital content or digital services, and should therefore be considered as a method of payment within the meaning of this Directive. Digital representations of value should also be understood to include virtual currencies, to the extent that they are recognised by national law. Differentiation depending on the methods of payment could be a cause of discrimination and provide an unjustified incentive for businesses to move towards supplying digital content or a digital service against digital representations of value. However, since digital representations of value have no other purpose than to serve as a method of payment, they themselves should not be considered digital content or a digital service within the meaning of this Directive. (24) Digital content or digital services are often supplied also where the consumer does not pay a price but provides personal data to the trader. Such business models are used in different forms in a considerable part of the market. While fully recognising that the protection of personal data is a fundamental right and that therefore personal data cannot be considered as a commodity, this Directive should ensure that consumers are, in the context of such business models, entitled to contractual remedies. This Directive should, therefore, apply to contracts where the trader supplies, or undertakes to supply, digital content or a digital service to the consumer, and the consumer provides, or undertakes to provide, personal data. The personal data could be provided to the trader either at the time when the contract is concluded or at a later time, such as when the consumer gives consent for the trader to use any personal data that the consumer might upload or create with the use of the digital content or digital service. Union law on the protection of personal data provides for an exhaustive list of legal grounds for the lawful processing of personal data. This Directive should apply to any contract where the consumer provides or undertakes to provide personal data to the trader. For example, this Directive should apply where the consumer opens a social media account and provides a name and email address that are used for purposes other than solely supplying the digital content or digital service, or other than complying with legal requirements. It should equally apply where the consumer gives consent for any material that constitutes personal data, such as photographs or posts that the consumer uploads, to be processed by the trader for marketing purposes. Member States should however remain free to determine whether the requirements for the formation, existence and validity of a contract under national law are fulfilled. (25) Where digital content and digital services are not supplied in exchange for a price, this Directive should not apply to situations where the trader collects personal data exclusively to supply digital content or a digital service, or for the sole purpose of meeting legal requirements. Such situations can include, for instance, cases where the registration of the consumer is required by applicable laws for security and identification purposes. This Directive should also not apply to situations where the trader only collects metadata, such as information concerning the consumer's device or browsing history, except where this situation is considered to be a contract under national law. It should also not apply to situations where the consumer, without having concluded a contract with the trader, is exposed to advertisements exclusively in order to gain access to digital content or a digital service. However, Member States should remain free to extend the application of this Directive to such situations, or to otherwise regulate such situations, which are excluded from the scope of this Directive. (26) This Directive should apply to contracts for the development of digital content that is tailor-made to the specific requirements of the consumer including tailor-made software. This Directive should also apply to the supply of electronic files required in the context of 3D printing of goods, to the extent that such files fall under the definition of digital content or digital services within the meaning of this Directive. However, this Directive should not regulate any rights or obligations related to goods produced with the use of 3D printing technology. (27) Given that this Directive should apply to contracts which have as their object the supply of digital content or a digital service to the consumer, it should not apply where the main subject matter of the contract is the provision of professional services, such as translation services, architectural services, legal services or other professional advice services, which are often performed personally by the trader, regardless of whether digital means are used by the trader in order to produce the output of the service or to deliver or transmit it to the consumer. Similarly, this Directive should not apply to public services, such as social security services or public registers, where the digital means are only used for transmitting or communicating the service to the consumer. This Directive should also not apply to authentic instruments and other notarial acts, regardless of whether they are performed, recorded, reproduced or transmitted by digital means. (28) The market for number-independent interpersonal communications services, which do not connect with publicly assigned numbering resources, is rapidly evolving. In recent years, the emergence of new digital services which allow interpersonal communications over the internet, such as web-based email and online messaging services, has led more consumers to use such services. For such reasons, it is necessary to provide effective consumer protection with respect to such services. This Directive should therefore also apply to number-independent interpersonal communications services. (29) This Directive should not apply to healthcare as defined in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). The exclusion of healthcare from the scope of this Directive should also apply to any digital content or digital service that constitutes a medical device, as defined in Council Directive 93/42/EEC (6) or 90/385/EEC (7) or Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), where such medical device is prescribed or provided by a health professional as defined in Directive 2011/24/EU. However, this Directive should apply to any digital content or digital service that constitutes a medical device, such as health applications, that can be obtained by the consumer without being prescribed or provided by a health professional. (30) Union law relating to financial services contains numerous rules on consumer protection. Financial services, as defined by the law applicable to that sector, in particular in Directive 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), also cover digital content or digital services relating, or giving access, to financial services and are therefore covered by the protection of Union financial services law. Contracts relating to digital content or digital services that constitute a financial service should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Directive. (31) This Directive should not apply to digital content or a digital service that is provided to a public audience as part of an artistic performance or other event, such as a digital cinematographic projection or an audiovisual theatrical performance. However, this Directive should apply if digital content or a digital service is provided to a public audience by signal transmission such as digital television services. (32) Free and open source software, where the source code is openly shared and users can freely access, use, modify and redistribute the software or modified versions thereof, can contribute to research and innovation in the market for digital content and digital services. In order to avoid imposing obstacles to such market developments, this Directive should also not apply to free and open source software, provided that it is not supplied in exchange for a price and that the consumer's personal data are exclusively used for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software. (33) Digital content or digital services are often combined with the provision of goods or other services and offered to the consumer within the same contract comprising a bundle of different elements, such as the provision of digital television and the purchase of electronic equipment. In such cases, the contract between the consumer and the trader includes elements of a contract for the supply of digital content or a digital service, but also elements of other contract types, such as sale of goods or services contracts. This Directive should only apply to the elements of the overall contract that consist of the supply of digital content or digital services. The other elements of the contract should be governed by the rules applicable to those contracts under national law or, as applicable, other Union law governing a specific sector or subject matter. Likewise, any effects that the termination of one element of the bundle contract could have on the other elements of that bundle contract should be governed by national law. However, in order to ensure consistency with the sector-specific provisions of Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) regulating bundle contracts, where a trader offers, within the meaning of that Directive, digital content or a digital service in combination with a number-based interpersonal communications service or an internet access service, the provisions of this Directive on the modification of digital content should not apply to the digital content or digital service element of the bundle. The relevant provisions of Directive (EU) 2018/1972 should instead apply to all elements of the bundle, including the digital content or digital service. (34) The provisions of this Directive concerning bundle contracts should only apply to cases where the different elements of the bundle are offered by the same trader to the same consumer under a single contract. This Directive should not affect national laws governing the conditions under which a contract for the supply of digital content or digital services can be considered to be linked with or ancillary to another contract that the consumer has concluded with the same or another trader, the remedies to be exercised under each contract or the effect that the termination of one contract would have on the other contract. (35) The commercial practice of bundling offers of digital content or digital services with the provision of goods or other services is subject to Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market. Such bundling is not in itself prohibited under Directive 2005/29/EC. However, it is prohibited where it is deemed unfair, following a case-by-case assessment pursuant to the criteria laid down in that Directive. Union law on competition also allows addressing tying and bundling practices, when they affect the competitive process and harm consumers. (36) This Directive should be without prejudice to other Union law governing a specific sector or subject matter, such as telecommunications, e-commerce and consumer protection. It should also be without prejudice to Union and national law on copyright and related rights, including the portability of online content services. (37) The pursuit of activities falling within the scope of this Directive could involve the processing of personal data. Union law provides a comprehensive framework on the protection of personal data. In particular, this Directive is without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (12) and Directive 2002/58/EC (13) of the European Parliament and of the Council. That framework applies to any personal data processed in connection with the contracts covered by this Directive. Consequently, personal data should only be collected or otherwise processed in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC. In the event of a conflict between this Directive and Union law on the protection of personal data, the latter should prevail. (38) This Directive should not regulate the conditions for the lawful processing of personal data, as this question is regulated, in particular, by Regulation (EU) 2016/679. As a consequence, any processing of personal data in connection with a contract falling within the scope of this Directive is lawful only if it is in conformity with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 relating to the legal grounds for the processing of personal data. Where processing of personal data is based on consent, in particular pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the specific provisions of that Regulation including those concerning the conditions for assessing whether consent is freely given apply. This Directive should not regulate the validity of the consent given. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also contains comprehensive rights as to the erasure of data and data portability. This Directive should be without prejudice to those rights, which apply to any personal data provided by the consumer to the trader or collected by the trader in connection with any contract falling within the scope of this Directive, and when the consumer terminated the contract in accordance with this Directive. (39) The right to erasure and the consumer's right to withdraw consent for the processing of personal data should apply fully also in connection with the contracts covered by this Directive. The right of the consumer to terminate the contract in accordance with this Directive should be without prejudice to the consumer's right under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to withdraw any consent given to the processing of the consumer's personal data. (40) This Directive should not regulate the consequences for the contracts covered by this Directive in the event that the consumer withdraws the consent for the processing of the consumer's personal data. Such consequences should remain a matter for national law. (41) There are various ways for the trader to supply digital content or digital services to consumers. It is opportune to set simple and clear rules as to the modalities and the time for performing that obligation to supply which is the main contractual obligation of the trader, by making the digital content or a digital service available or accessible to the consumer. The digital content or digital service should be considered to be made available or accessible to the consumer when the digital content or digital service, or any means suitable for accessing or downloading it, has reached the sphere of the consumer and no further action is required by the trader in order to enable the consumer to use the digital content or digital service in accordance with the contract. Considering that the trader is not in principle responsible for acts or omissions of a third party which operates a physical or virtual facility, for instance an electronic platform or a cloud storage facility, that the consumer selects for receiving or storing the digital content or digital service, it should be sufficient for the trader to supply the digital content or digital service to that third party. However, the physical or virtual facility cannot be considered to be chosen by the consumer if it is under the trader's control or is contractually linked to the trader, or where the consumer selected that physical or virtual facility for receipt of the digital content or digital service but that choice was the only one offered by the trader to receive or access the digital content or digital service. Where the physical or virtual facility cannot be considered to have been chosen by the consumer, the obligation of the trader to supply the digital content or digital service should not be considered to have been fulfilled if the digital content or digital service is supplied to the physical or virtual facility but the consumer cannot receive or access the digital content or digital service in accordance with this Directive. In those cases, the consumer should have the same remedies as would apply if the trader had failed to supply the digital content or digital service. With regard to the time of supply, in line with market practices and technical possibilities, and in order to provide for a certain degree of flexibility, the digital content or digital service should be supplied without undue delay, unless the parties decide to agree otherwise in order to cater for other supply models. (42) The digital content or digital service should comply with the requirements agreed between the trader and the consumer in the contract. In particular, it should comply with the description, quantity, for example the number of music files that can be accessed, quality, for example the picture resolution, language and version agreed in the contract. It should also possess the security, functionality, compatibility, interoperability and other features, as required by the contract. The requirements of the contract should include those resulting from the pre-contractual information which, in accordance with Directive 2011/83/EU, forms an integral part of the contract. Those requirements could also be set out in a service level agreement, where, under the applicable national law, such type of agreement forms part of the contractual relationship between the consumer and the trader. (43) The notion of functionality should be understood to refer to the ways in which digital content or a digital service can be used. For instance, the absence or presence of any technical restrictions such as protection via Digital Rights Management or region coding could have an impact on the ability of the digital content or digital service to perform all its functions having regard to its purpose. The notion of interoperability relates to whether and to what extent digital content or a digital service is able to function with hardware or software that is different from those with which digital content or digital services of the same type are normally used. Successful functioning could include, for instance, the ability of the digital content or digital service to exchange information with such other software or hardware and to use the information exchanged. (44) Given that digital content and digital services are constantly developing, traders may agree with consumers to provide updates and features as they become available. The conformity of the digital content or digital service should, therefore, also be assessed in relation to whether the digital content or service is updated in the manner that has been stipulated in the contract. Failure to supply updates that had been agreed to in the contract should be considered a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service. Moreover, defective or incomplete updates should also be considered a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service, given that that would mean that such updates are not performed in the manner stipulated in the contract. (45) In order to be in conformity and to ensure that consumers are not deprived of their rights, for example in cases where the contract sets very low standards, the digital content or digital service should not only comply with the subjective requirements for conformity, but should in addition comply with the objective requirements for conformity set out in this Directive. Conformity should be assessed, inter alia, by considering the purpose for which digital content or digital services of the same type would normally be used. It should also possess the qualities and performance features which are normal for digital content or digital services of the same type and which consumers can reasonably expect, given the nature of the digital content or digital service, and taking into account any public statements on the specific characteristics of the digital content or digital service made by or on behalf of the trader or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions. (46) The standard of reasonableness with regard to any reference in this Directive to what can be reasonably expected by a person should be objectively ascertained, having regard to the nature and purpose of the digital content or digital service, the circumstances of the case and to the usages and practices of the parties involved. In particular, what is considered to be a reasonable time for bringing the digital content or digital service into conformity should be objectively ascertained, having regard to the nature of the lack of conformity. (47) For the period of time that the consumer would reasonably expect, the trader should provide the consumer with updates, including security updates, in order to keep the digital content or digital service in conformity and secure. For instance, as regards digital content or digital services, the purpose of which is limited in time, the obligation to provide updates should be limited to that time, while for other types of digital content or digital service the period during which updates should be provided to the consumer could be equal to the liability period for lack of conformity or could extend beyond that period, which might be the case particularly with regard to security updates. The consumer should remain free to choose whether to install the updates provided. Where the consumer decides not to install the updates, the consumer should, however, not expect the digital content or digital service to remain in conformity. The trader should inform the consumer that the consumer's decision not to install updates which are necessary for keeping the digital content or digital service in conformity, including security updates, will affect the trader's liability for conformity of those features of the digital content or digital service which the relevant updates are supposed to maintain in conformity. This Directive should not affect obligations to provide security updates laid down in Union law or in national law. (48) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or any other Union law on data protection should fully apply to the processing of personal data in connection with any contract falling within the scope of this Directive. In addition, this Directive should be without prejudice to the rights, obligations and non-contractual remedies provided for by Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Facts leading to a lack of compliance with requirements provided for by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including core principles such as the requirements for data minimisation, data protection by design and data protection by default, may, depending on the circumstances of the case, also be considered to constitute a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service with subjective or objective requirements for conformity provided for in this Directive. One example could be where a trader explicitly assumes an obligation in the contract, or the contract can be interpreted in that way, which is also linked to the trader's obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In that case, such a contractual commitment can become part of the subjective requirements for conformity. A second example could be where non-compliance with the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 could, at the same time render the digital content or digital service unfit for its intended purpose and, therefore, constitute a lack of conformity with the objective requirement for conformity which requires the digital content or digital service to be fit for the purposes for which digital content or digital services of the same type would be normally used. This would be the case, for example, if the trader of data encryption software fails to implement appropriate measures as required by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to ensure that by design personal data are not disclosed to unauthorised recipients, thus rendering the encryption software unfit for its intended purpose which is the secure transferring of data by the consumer to their intended recipient. Finally, there could be cases where the trader's non-compliance with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 can also constitute a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service with the objective requirement for conformity which requires the digital content or digital service to possess the features which are normal for digital content or digital services of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect. For instance, if the trader of an online shopping application fails to take the measures provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the security of processing of the consumer's personal data and as a result the consumer's credit card information is exposed to malware or spyware, that failure could also constitute a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service within the meaning of this Directive, as the consumer would reasonably expect that an application of this type would normally possess features preventing the disclosure of payment details. Where the facts leading to non-compliance with requirements under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also constitute a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service with subjective or objective requirements for conformity as provided for in this Directive, the consumer should be entitled to the remedies for the lack of conformity provided for by this Directive, unless the contract is already void or voidable under national law. (49) In order to ensure sufficient flexibility, it should be possible for the parties to deviate from the objective requirements for conformity. Such a deviation should only be possible if the consumer was specifically informed about it and if the consumer accepts it separately from other statements or agreements and by way of active and unequivocal conduct. Both conditions could, for instance, be fulfilled by ticking a box, pressing a button or activating a similar function. (50) When applying the rules of this Directive, traders should make use of standards, open technical specifications, good practices and codes of conduct, including in relation to the commonly used and machine-readable format for retrieving the content other than personal data, which was provided or created by the consumer when using the digital content or digital service, and including on the security of information systems and digital environments, whether established at international level, Union level or at the level of a specific industry sector. In this context, the Commission could call for the development of international and Union standards and the drawing up of a code of conduct by trade associations and other representative organisations that could support the uniform implementation of this Directive. (51) Many types of digital content or digital services are supplied continuously over a period of time, such as access to cloud services. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the digital content or digital service is in conformity throughout the duration of the contract. Short-term interruptions of the supply of digital content or a digital service should be treated as instances of lack of conformity where those interruptions are more than negligible or recur. Moreover, given the frequent improvement of digital content and digital services, in particular by updates, the version of digital content or of a digital service supplied to the consumer should be the most recent one available at the time of the conclusion of the contract, unless the parties have agreed otherwise. (52) In order to work properly, the digital content or digital service needs to be correctly integrated into the consumer's hardware and software environment. A lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service that results from an incorrect integration should be regarded as a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service itself, where it was integrated by the trader or under its control, or by the consumer following the trader's instructions for integration, and the incorrect integration was due to shortcomings in the required integration instructions, such as incompleteness or a lack of clarity making the integration instructions difficult to use for the average consumer. (53) Restrictions of the consumer's use of the digital content or digital service in accordance with this Directive could result from limitations imposed by the holder of intellectual property rights in accordance with intellectual property law. Such restrictions can arise from the end-user license agreement under which the digital content or digital service is supplied to the consumer. This can be the case when, for instance, an end-user licence agreement prohibits the consumer from making use of certain features related to the functionality of the digital content or digital service. Such a restriction could render the digital content or digital service in breach of the objective requirements for conformity laid down in this Directive, if it concerned features which are usually found in digital content or digital services of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect. In such cases, the consumer should be able to claim the remedies provided for in this Directive for the lack of conformity against the trader who supplied the digital content or digital service. The trader should only be able to avoid such liability by fulfilling the conditions for derogating from the objective requirements for conformity as laid down in this Directive, namely only if the trader specifically informs the consumer before the conclusion of the contract that a particular characteristic of the digital content or digital service deviates from the objective requirements for conformity and the consumer has expressly and separately accepted that deviation. (54) Legal defects are a particularly important issue in relation to digital content or digital services, which are subject to intellectual property rights. Restrictions on the consumer's use of digital content or a digital service in accordance with this Directive could be a result of a violation of third-party rights. Such violation might effectively bar the consumer from enjoying the digital content or digital service or some of its features, for instance when the consumer cannot access the digital content or digital service at all or cannot do so lawfully. That might be due to the fact that the third party rightfully compels the trader to stop infringing those rights and to discontinue offering the digital content or digital service in question or that the consumer cannot use the digital content or digital service without infringing the law. In the event of a violation of third-party rights that results in a restriction that prevents or limits the use of the digital content or digital service in accordance with the subjective and objective requirements for conformity, the consumer should be entitled to the remedies for the lack of conformity, unless national law provides for the nullity of the contract, or for its rescission, for example for breach of legal warranty against eviction. (55) The trader should be liable to the consumer in the event of a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service, and for any failure to supply the digital content or digital service. As digital content or digital services can be supplied to consumers through one or more individual acts of supply or continuously over a period of time, it is appropriate that the relevant time for the purpose of establishing conformity of the digital content or digital service be determined in the light of those different types of supply. (56) Digital content or digital services can be supplied to consumers through a single act of supply, for instance when consumers download an e-book and store it on their personal device. Similarly, the supply can consist of a series of such individual acts, for instance where consumers receive a link to download a new e-book every week. The distinctive element of this category of digital content or digital service is the fact that consumers thereafter have the possibility to access and use the digital content or digital service indefinitely. In such cases, the conformity of the digital content or digital service should be assessed at the time of supply, and therefore the trader should only be liable for any lack of conformity which exists at the time when the single act of supply or each individual act of supply takes place. In order to ensure legal certainty, traders and consumers should be able to rely on a harmonised minimum period during which the trader should be held liable for a lack of conformity. In relation to contracts which provide for a single act of supply or a series of individual acts of supply of the digital content or digital service, Member States should ensure that traders are liable for not less than two years from the time of supply, if under their respective national law the trader is only liable for any lack of conformity that becomes apparent within a period of time after supply. (57) Digital content or digital services could also be supplied to consumers in a continuous manner over a period of time. Continuous supply can include cases whereby the trader makes a digital service available to consumers for a fixed or an indefinite period of time, such as a two-year cloud storage contract or an indefinite social media platform membership. The distinctive element of this category is the fact that the digital content or digital service is available or accessible to consumers only for the fixed duration of the contract or for as long as the indefinite contract is in force. Therefore, it is justified that the trader, in such cases, should only be liable for a lack of conformity which appears during that period of time. The element of continuous supply should not necessarily require a long-term supply. Cases such as web-streaming of a video clip should be considered continuous supply over a period of time, regardless of the actual duration of the audio-visual file. Cases where specific elements of the digital content or digital service are made available periodically or on several instances during the fixed duration of the contract, or for as long as the indefinite contract is in force, should also be considered a continuous supply over a period of time, for instance where the contract stipulates that a copy of anti-virus software can be used for a year and will be automatically updated on the first day of each month of this period, or that the trader will issue updates whenever new features of a digital game become available, and the digital content or digital service is available or accessible to consumers only for the fixed duration of the contract or for as long as the indefinite contract is in force. (58) Member States should remain free to regulate national limitation periods. However, such limitation periods should not prevent consumers from exercising their rights throughout the period of time during which the trader is liable for a lack of conformity. While this Directive should therefore not harmonise the starting point of national limitation periods, it should nevertheless ensure that such periods still allow consumers to exercise their remedies for any lack of conformity that becomes apparent at least during the period during which the trader is liable for a lack of conformity. (59) Due to the specific nature and high complexity of digital content and digital services, as well as the trader's better knowledge and access to know-how, technical information and high-tech assistance, the trader is likely to be in a better position than the consumer to know why the digital content or digital service is not supplied or is not in conformity. The trader is also likely to be in a better position to assess whether the failure to supply or the lack of conformity is due to the incompatibility of the consumer's digital environment with the technical requirements for the digital content or digital service. Therefore in the event of a dispute, while it is for the consumer to provide evidence that the digital content or digital service is not in conformity, the consumer should not have to prove that the lack of conformity existed at the time of supply of the digital content or digital service or, in the event of continuous supply, during the duration of the contract. Instead, it should be for the trader to prove that the digital content or digital service was in conformity at that time or during that period. That burden of proof should be on the trader for a lack of conformity which becomes apparent within one year from the time of supply where the contract provides for a single act of supply or a series of individual acts of supply, and for the duration of the contract where the contract provides for continuous supply over a period of time. However, where the trader proves that the consumer's digital environment is not compatible with the technical requirements, of which the trader informed the consumer in a clear and comprehensible manner before the conclusion of the contract, the consumer should have the burden of proving that the lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service existed at the time of supply of the digital content or digital service where the contract provides for a single act of supply or a series of individual acts of supply or, where the contract provides for continuous supply over a period of time, for the duration of the contract. (60) Without prejudice to the fundamental right to the protection of private life, including confidentiality of communications, and to the protection of personal data of the consumer, the consumer should cooperate with the trader in order for the trader to ascertain whether the cause of the lack of conformity lies in the consumer's digital environment using the technically available means which are least intrusive for the consumer. This can often be done for instance by providing the trader with automatically generated incident reports or with details of the consumer's internet connection. Only in exceptional and duly justified circumstances where, despite the best use of all other means, there is no other way possible, consumers may need to allow virtual access to their digital environment. However, where the consumer does not cooperate with the trader and the consumer had been informed of the consequences of non-cooperation, it should be for the consumer to prove not only that the digital content or digital service is not in conformity, but also that the digital content or digital service was not in conformity at the time of supply of the digital content or digital service where the contract provides for a single act of supply or a series of individual acts of supply or, where the contract provides for continuous supply over a period of time, for the duration of the contract. (61) Where the trader has failed to supply the digital content or digital service, the consumer should call upon the trader to supply the digital content or digital service. In such cases, the trader should act without undue delay, or within an additional period of time as expressly agreed to by the parties. Considering that digital content or a digital service is supplied in digital form, the supply should not require, in the majority of situations, any additional time to make the digital content or digital service available to the consumer. Therefore, in such cases, the obligation of the trader to supply the digital content or digital service without undue delay should mean having to supply it immediately. If the trader then fails to supply the digital content or digital service, the consumer should be entitled to terminate the contract. In specific circumstances, such as where it is clear that the trader will not supply the digital content or digital service or where a specific time for the supply is essential for the consumer, the consumer should be entitled to terminate the contract without first calling upon the trader to supply the digital content or digital service. (62) In the case of lack of conformity, consumers should be entitled to have the digital content or digital service brought into conformity, to have a proportionate reduction in the price, or to terminate the contract. (63) Depending on the technical characteristics of the digital content or digital service, the trader should be allowed to select a specific way of bringing the digital content or digital service into conformity, for example by issuing updates or making a new copy of the digital content or digital service available to the consumer. (64) Given the diversity of digital content and digital services, it is not appropriate to set fixed deadlines for the exercise of rights or the fulfilling of obligations related to digital content or digital services. Such deadlines would not take account of such diversity and could be either too short or too long, depending on the case. It is therefore more appropriate to require that digital content and digital services be brought into conformity within a reasonable time. Such requirement should not prevent the parties from agreeing on a specific time for bringing the digital content or digital service into conformity. The digital content or digital service should be brought into conformity free of any charge. In particular, the consumer should not incur any costs associated with the development of an update for the digital content or digital service. (65) Where bringing digital content or a digital service into conformity is legally or factually impossible or where the trader refuses to bring the digital content or digital service into conformity because to do so would impose disproportionate costs on the trader, or where the trader has failed to bring the digital content or digital service into conformity within a reasonable time, free of charge and without causing significant inconvenience to the consumer, the consumer should be entitled to the remedies of price reduction or termination of the contract. In certain situations, it is justified that the consumer should be entitled to have the price reduced or the contract terminated immediately, for instance where the trader previously failed to successfully bring the digital content or digital service into conformity or where the consumer cannot be expected to maintain confidence in the ability of the trader to bring the digital content or digital service into conformity due to the serious nature of the lack of conformity. For example, the consumer should be entitled to directly request a price reduction or the termination of the contract where the consumer is supplied with anti-virus software which is itself infected with viruses and would constitute an instance of lack of conformity of such a serious nature. The same should apply where it is clear that the trader will not bring the digital content or digital service into conformity within a reasonable time or without significant inconvenience for the consumer. (66) In a situation where the consumer is entitled to a reduction of the price paid for the digital content or digital service which is supplied over a period of time, the calculation of the price reduction should take into consideration the decrease of value of the digital content or digital service due both to the lack of conformity and to the time during which the consumer was unable to enjoy the digital content or digital service in conformity. (67) Where the digital content or digital service is supplied in exchange for a price, the consumer should be able to terminate the contract only if the lack of conformity is not minor. However, where the digital content or digital service is not supplied in exchange for a price but personal data are provided by the consumer, the consumer should be entitled to terminate the contract also in cases where the lack of conformity is minor, since the remedy of price reduction is not available to the consumer. In cases where the consumer pays a price and provides personal data, the consumer should be entitled to all available remedies in the event of a lack of conformity. In particular, provided all other conditions are met, the consumer should be entitled to have the digital content or digital service brought into conformity, to have the price reduced in relation to the money paid for the digital content or digital service or to have the contract terminated. (68) Where the consumer terminates the contract, the trader should reimburse the price paid by the consumer. However, there is a need to balance the legitimate interests of consumers and traders where the digital content or digital service is supplied over a period of time and the digital content or digital service was in conformity only for part of that period. Therefore, upon termination, the consumer should only be entitled to the part of the price paid that corresponds and is in proportion to the length of time during which the digital content or digital service was not in conformity. The consumer should also be entitled to any part of the price paid in advance for any period that would have remained after the contract was terminated. (69) Where personal data are provided by the consumer to the trader, the trader should comply with the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Such obligations should also be complied with in cases where the consumer pays a price and provides personal data. Upon termination of the contract, the trader should also refrain from using any content other than personal data, which was provided or created by the consumer when using the digital content or digital service supplied by the trader. Such content could include digital images, video and audio files and content created on mobile devices. However, the trader should be entitled to continue to use the content provided or created by the consumer in cases where such content either has no utility outside the context of the digital content or digital service supplied by the trader, only relates to the consumer's activity, has been aggregated with other data by the trader and cannot be disaggregated or only with disproportionate efforts, or has been generated jointly by the consumer and others, and other consumers can continue to make use of it. (70) The consumer could be discouraged from exercising remedies for a lack of conformity of digital content or a digital service if the consumer is deprived of access to content other than personal data, which the consumer provided or created through the use of the digital content or digital service. In order to ensure that the consumer benefits from effective protection in relation to the right to terminate the contract, the trader should therefore, at the request of the consumer, make such content available to the consumer following the termination of the contract. (71) The consumer should be entitled to retrieve the content within a reasonable time, without hindrance from the trader, in a commonly used machine-readable format and free of charge, with the exception of costs generated by the consumer's own digital environment, for instance the costs of a network connection as those costs are not specifically linked to the retrieval of the content. However, the obligation of the trader to make available such content should not apply where the content only has utility within the context of using the digital content or digital service, or relates only to the consumer's activity when using the digital content or digital service or has been aggregated with other data by the trader and cannot be disaggregated or only with disproportionate efforts. In such cases, the content does not have significant practical use or interest for the consumer while taking into account also the interests of the trader. Moreover, the obligation of the trader to make available to the consumer, upon termination of the contract, any content that is not personal data and has been provided or created by the consumer should be without prejudice to the trader's right not to disclose certain content in accordance with applicable law. (72) Where the contract is terminated, the consumer should not be required to pay for the use of the digital content or digital service for any period during which the digital content or a digital service was not in conformity because that would deprive the consumer of effective protection. However, the consumer should also refrain from using the digital content or digital service and from making it available to third parties, for instance by deleting the digital content or any usable copy or rendering the digital content or digital service otherwise inaccessible. (73) The principle of the liability of the trader for damages is an essential element of contracts for the supply of digital content or digital services. Therefore, the consumer should be entitled to claim compensation for detriment caused by a lack of conformity or a failure to supply the digital content or digital service. The compensation should put the consumer as much as possible into the position in which the consumer would have been had the digital content or digital service been duly supplied and been in conformity. As such a right to damages already exists in all Member States, this Directive should be without prejudice to national rules on the compensation of consumers for harm resulting from infringement of those rules. (74) This Directive should also address modifications, such as updates and upgrades, which are carried out by traders on the digital content or digital service which is supplied or made accessible to the consumer over a period of time. Considering the fast-evolving character of digital content and digital services, such updates, upgrades or similar modifications may be necessary and are often advantageous for the consumer. Some modifications, for instance those stipulated as updates in the contract, may form part of the contractual commitment. Other modifications can be required to fulfil the objective requirements for conformity of the digital content or digital service as set out in this Directive. Yet other modifications, which would deviate from the objective requirements for conformity and which are foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract, would have to be expressly agreed to by the consumer when concluding the contract. (75) In addition to modifications aimed at maintaining conformity, the trader should be allowed under certain conditions to modify features of the digital content or digital service, provided that the contract gives a valid reason for such a modification. Such valid reasons could encompass cases where the modification is necessary to adapt the digital content or digital service to a new technical environment or to an increased number of users or for other important operational reasons. Such modifications are often to the advantage of the consumer as they improve the digital content or digital service. Consequently, the parties to the contract should be able to include clauses in the contract which allow the trader to undertake modifications. In order to balance consumer and business interests, such a possibility for the trader should be coupled with a right for the consumer to terminate the contract where such modifications negatively impact the use of or access to the digital content or digital service in more than only a minor manner. The extent to which modifications negatively impact the use of or access to the digital content or digital service by the consumer should be objectively ascertained having regard to the nature and purpose of the digital content or digital service and to the quality, functionality, compatibility and other main features which are normal for digital content or digital services of the same type. The rules provided for in this Directive concerning such updates, upgrades or similar modifications should however not concern situations where the parties conclude a new contract for the supply of the digital content or digital service, for instance as a consequence of distributing a new version of the digital content or digital service. (76) Consumers should be informed of modifications in a clear and comprehensible manner. Where a modification negatively impacts, in more than a minor manner, the access to or use of digital content or a digital service by the consumer, the consumer should be informed in a way that allows the information to be stored on a durable medium. A durable medium should enable the consumer to store the information for as long as is necessary to protect the interests of the consumer arising from the consumer's relationship with the trader. Such media should include, in particular, paper, DVDs, CDs, USB sticks, memory cards or hard disks as well as emails. (77) Where a modification negatively impacts, in more than a minor manner, the access or use of the digital content or digital service by the consumer, the consumer should enjoy as a result of such a modification the right to terminate the contract free of any charge. Alternatively, the trader can decide to enable the consumer to maintain access to the digital content or digital service at no additional cost, without the modification and in conformity, in which case the consumer should not be entitled to terminate the contract. However, if the digital content or digital service that the trader enabled the consumer to maintain is no longer in conformity with the subjective and the objective requirements for conformity, the consumer should be able to rely on the remedies for a lack of conformity as provided for under this Directive. Where the requirements for such a modification as laid down in this Directive are not satisfied and the modification results in a lack of conformity, the consumer's right to bring the digital content or digital service into conformity, have the price reduced or the contract terminated, as provided for under this Directive, should remain unaffected. Similarly, where, subsequent to a modification, a lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service that has not been caused by the modification arises, the consumer should continue to be entitled to rely on remedies as provided for under this Directive for the lack of conformity in relation to this digital content or digital service. (78) The lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service as supplied to the consumer is often due to one of the transactions in a chain that links the original designer to the final trader. While the final trader should be liable towards the consumer in the event of a lack of conformity, it is important to ensure that the trader has appropriate rights vis-Ã -vis different persons in the chain of transactions in order to be able to cover the liability towards the consumer. Such rights should be limited to commercial transactions and they should therefore not cover situations where the trader is liable towards the consumer for the lack of conformity of digital content or a digital service that is composed of or built upon software which was supplied without the payment of a price under a free and open-source licence by a person in previous links of the chain of transactions. However, it should be for the Member States under their applicable national law to identify the persons in the chain of transactions against which the final trader can turn and the modalities and conditions of such actions. (79) Persons or organisations regarded under national law as having a legitimate interest in protecting consumer contractual and data protection rights should be afforded the right to initiate proceedings to ensure that the national provisions transposing this Directive are applied, either before a court or before an administrative authority which is competent to decide upon complaints, or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings. (80) Nothing in this Directive should prejudice the application of the rules of private international law, in particular Regulations (EC) No 593/2008 (14) and (EU) No 1215/2012 (15) of the European Parliament and of the Council. (81) The Annex to Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) should be amended to include a reference to this Directive so as to facilitate cross-border cooperation on enforcement of this Directive. (82) Annex I to Directive 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (17) should be amended to include a reference to this Directive so as to ensure that the collective interests of consumers laid down in this Directive are protected. (83) Consumers should be able to benefit from their rights under this Directive as soon as the corresponding national transposition measures begin to apply. Those national transposition measures should, therefore, also apply to contracts of an indefinite or fixed duration which were concluded before the application date and provide for the supply of digital content or digital services over a period of time, either continuously or through a series of individual acts of supply, but only as regards digital content or a digital service that is supplied from the date of application of the national transposition measures. However, in order to ensure a balance between the legitimate interests of consumers and traders, the national measures transposing the provisions of this Directive on the modification of the digital content or digital service and the right to redress should only apply to contracts concluded after the application date pursuant to this Directive. (84) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (18), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. (85) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) and delivered an opinion on 14 March 2017 (20). (86) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to contribute to the functioning of the internal market by tackling in a consistent manner contract law related obstacles for the supply of digital content or digital services while preventing legal fragmentation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reasons of ensuring the overall coherence of the national laws through harmonised contract law rules which would also facilitate coordinated enforcement actions, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (87) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and freedoms and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including those enshrined in Articles 16, 38 and 47 thereof, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Subject matter and purpose The purpose of this Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market while providing for a high level of consumer protection, by laying down common rules on certain requirements concerning contracts between traders and consumers for the supply of digital content or digital services, in particular, rules on:  the conformity of digital content or a digital service with the contract,  remedies in the event of a lack of such conformity or a failure to supply, and the modalities for the exercise of those remedies, and  the modification of digital content or a digital service. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (1) digital content means data which are produced and supplied in digital form; (2) digital service means: (a) a service that allows the consumer to create, process, store or access data in digital form; or (b) a service that allows the sharing of or any other interaction with data in digital form uploaded or created by the consumer or other users of that service; (3) goods with digital elements means any tangible movable items that incorporate, or are inter-connected with, digital content or a digital service in such a way that the absence of that digital content or digital service would prevent the goods from performing their functions; (4) integration means the linking and incorporation of digital content or a digital service with the components of the consumer's digital environment in order for the digital content or digital service to be used in accordance with the requirements for conformity provided for by this Directive; (5) trader means any natural or legal person, irrespective of whether privately or publicly owned, that is acting, including through any other person acting in that natural or legal person's name or on that person's behalf, for purposes relating to that person's trade, business, craft, or profession, in relation to contracts covered by this Directive; (6) consumer means any natural person who, in relation to contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside that person's trade, business, craft, or profession; (7) price means money or a digital representation of value that is due in exchange for the supply of digital content or a digital service; (8) personal data means personal data as defined in point (1) of Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679; (9) digital environment means hardware, software and any network connection used by the consumer to access or make use of digital content or a digital service; (10) compatibility means the ability of the digital content or digital service to function with hardware or software with which digital content or digital services of the same type are normally used, without the need to convert the digital content or digital service; (11) functionality means the ability of the digital content or digital service to perform its functions having regard to its purpose; (12) interoperability means the ability of the digital content or digital service to function with hardware or software different from those with which digital content or digital services of the same type are normally used; (13) durable medium means any instrument which enables the consumer or the trader to store information addressed personally to that person in a way that is accessible for future reference, for a period of time adequate for the purposes of the information and which allows the unchanged reproduction of the information stored. Article 3 Scope 1. This Directive shall apply to any contract where the trader supplies or undertakes to supply digital content or a digital service to the consumer and the consumer pays or undertakes to pay a price. This Directive shall also apply where the trader supplies or undertakes to supply digital content or a digital service to the consumer, and the consumer provides or undertakes to provide personal data to the trader, except where the personal data provided by the consumer are exclusively processed by the trader for the purpose of supplying the digital content or digital service in accordance with this Directive or for allowing the trader to comply with legal requirements to which the trader is subject, and the trader does not process those data for any other purpose. 2. This Directive shall also apply where the digital content or digital service is developed in accordance with the consumer's specifications. 3. With the exception of Articles 5 and 13, this Directive shall also apply to any tangible medium which serves exclusively as a carrier of digital content. 4. This Directive shall not apply to digital content or digital services which are incorporated in or inter-connected with goods within the meaning of point (3) of Article 2, and which are provided with the goods under a sales contract concerning those goods, irrespective of whether such digital content or digital service is supplied by the seller or by a third party. In the event of doubt as to whether the supply of incorporated or inter-connected digital content or an incorporated or inter-connected digital service forms part of the sales contract, the digital content or digital service shall be presumed to be covered by the sales contract. 5. This Directive shall not apply to contracts regarding: (a) the provision of services other than digital services, regardless of whether digital forms or means are used by the trader to produce the output of the service or to deliver or transmit it to the consumer; (b) electronic communications services as defined in point (4) of Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2018/1972, with the exception of number-independent interpersonal communications services as defined in point (7) of Article 2 of that Directive; (c) healthcare as defined in point (a) of Article 3 of Directive 2011/24/EU; (d) gambling services, namely, services that involve wagering a stake with pecuniary value in games of chance, including those with an element of skill, such as lotteries, casino games, poker games and betting transactions, by electronic means or any other technology for facilitating communication and at the individual request of a recipient of such services; (e) financial services as defined in point (b) of Article 2 of Directive 2002/65/EC; (f) software offered by the trader under a free and open-source licence, where the consumer does not pay a price and the personal data provided by the consumer are exclusively processed by the trader for the purpose of improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of that specific software; (g) the supply of digital content where the digital content is made available to the general public other than by signal transmission as a part of a performance or event, such as digital cinematographic projections; (h) digital content provided in accordance with Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (21) by public sector bodies of the Member States. 6. Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of this Article, where a single contract between the same trader and the same consumer includes in a bundle elements of supply of digital content or a digital service and elements of the provision of other services or goods, this Directive shall only apply to the elements of the contract concerning the digital content or digital service. Article 19 of this Directive shall not apply where a bundle within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2018/1972 includes elements of an internet access service as defined in point (2) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 of the European Parliament and of the Council (22) or a number-based interpersonal communications service as defined in point (6) of Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2018/1972. Without prejudice to Article 107(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/1972, the effects that the termination of one element of a bundle contract may have on the other elements of the bundle contract shall be governed by national law. 7. If any provision of this Directive conflicts with a provision of another Union act governing a specific sector or subject matter, the provision of that other Union act shall take precedence over this Directive. 8. Union law on the protection of personal data shall apply to any personal data processed in connection with contracts referred to in paragraph 1. In particular, this Directive shall be without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Directive and Union law on the protection of personal data, the latter prevails. 9. This Directive shall be without prejudice to Union and national law on copyright and related rights, including Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (23). 10. This Directive shall not affect the freedom of Member States to regulate aspects of general contract law, such as rules on the formation, validity, nullity or effects of contracts, including the consequences of the termination of a contract in so far as they are not regulated in this Directive, or the right to damages. Article 4 Level of harmonisation Member States shall not maintain or introduce, in their national law, provisions diverging from those laid down in this Directive, including more, or less, stringent provisions to ensure a different level of consumer protection, unless otherwise provided for in this Directive. Article 5 Supply of the digital content or digital service 1. The trader shall supply the digital content or digital service to the consumer. Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the trader shall supply the digital content or digital service without undue delay after the conclusion of the contract. 2. The trader shall have complied with the obligation to supply when: (a) the digital content or any means suitable for accessing or downloading the digital content is made available or accessible to the consumer, or to a physical or virtual facility chosen by the consumer for that purpose; (b) the digital service is made accessible to the consumer or to a physical or virtual facility chosen by the consumer for that purpose. Article 6 Conformity of the digital content or digital service The trader shall supply to the consumer digital content or a digital service that meets the requirements set out in Articles 7, 8 and 9, where applicable, without prejudice to Article 10. Article 7 Subjective requirements for conformity In order to conform with the contract, the digital content or digital service shall, in particular, where applicable: (a) be of the description, quantity and quality, and possess the functionality, compatibility, interoperability and other features, as required by the contract; (b) be fit for any particular purpose for which the consumer requires it and which the consumer made known to the trader at the latest at the time of the conclusion of the contract, and in respect of which the trader has given acceptance; (c) be supplied with all accessories, instructions, including on installation, and customer assistance as required by the contract; and (d) be updated as stipulated by the contract. Article 8 Objective requirements for conformity 1. In addition to complying with any subjective requirement for conformity, the digital content or digital service shall: (a) be fit for the purposes for which digital content or digital services of the same type would normally be used, taking into account, where applicable, any existing Union and national law, technical standards or, in the absence of such technical standards, applicable sector-specific industry codes of conduct; (b) be of the quantity and possess the qualities and performance features, including in relation to functionality, compatibility, accessibility, continuity and security, normal for digital content or digital services of the same type and which the consumer may reasonably expect, given the nature of the digital content or digital service and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of the trader, or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, particularly in advertising or on labelling unless the trader shows that: (i) the trader was not, and could not reasonably have been, aware of the public statement in question; (ii) by the time of conclusion of the contract, the public statement had been corrected in the same way as, or in a way comparable to how, it had been made; or (iii) the decision to acquire the digital content or digital service could not have been influenced by the public statement; (c) where applicable, be supplied along with any accessories and instructions which the consumer may reasonably expect to receive; and (d) comply with any trial version or preview of the digital content or digital service, made available by the trader before the conclusion of the contract. 2. The trader shall ensure that the consumer is informed of and supplied with updates, including security updates, that are necessary to keep the digital content or digital service in conformity, for the period of time: (a) during which the digital content or digital service is to be supplied under the contract, where the contract provides for a continuous supply over a period of time; or (b) that the consumer may reasonably expect, given the type and purpose of the digital content or digital service and taking into account the circumstances and nature of the contract, where the contract provides for a single act of supply or a series of individual acts of supply. 3. Where the consumer fails to install, within a reasonable time, updates supplied by the trader in accordance with paragraph 2, the trader shall not be liable for any lack of conformity resulting solely from the lack of the relevant update, provided that: (a) the trader informed the consumer about the availability of the update and the consequences of the failure of the consumer to install it; and (b) the failure of the consumer to install or the incorrect installation by the consumer of the update was not due to shortcomings in the installation instructions provided by the trader. 4. Where the contract provides for a continuous supply of digital content or digital service over a period of time, the digital content or digital service shall be in conformity throughout the duration of that period. 5. There shall be no lack of conformity within the meaning of paragraph 1 or 2 if, at the time of the conclusion of the contract, the consumer was specifically informed that a particular characteristic of the digital content or digital service was deviating from the objective requirements for conformity laid down in paragraph 1 or 2 and the consumer expressly and separately accepted that deviation when concluding the contract. 6. Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, digital content or a digital service shall be supplied in the most recent version available at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Article 9 Incorrect integration of the digital content or digital service Any lack of conformity resulting from the incorrect integration of the digital content or digital service into the consumer's digital environment shall be regarded as lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service if: (a) the digital content or digital service was integrated by the trader or under the trader's responsibility; or (b) the digital content or digital service was intended to be integrated by the consumer and the incorrect integration was due to shortcomings in the integration instructions provided by the trader. Article 10 Third-party rights Where a restriction resulting from a violation of any right of a third party, in particular intellectual property rights, prevents or limits the use of the digital content or digital service in accordance with Articles 7 and 8, Member States shall ensure that the consumer is entitled to the remedies for lack of conformity provided for in Article 14, unless national law provides for the nullity or rescission of the contract for the supply of the digital content or digital service in such cases. Article 11 Liability of the trader 1. The trader shall be liable for any failure to supply the digital content or digital service in accordance with Article 5. 2. Where a contract provides for a single act of supply or a series of individual acts of supply, the trader shall be liable for any lack of conformity under Articles 7, 8 and 9 which exists at the time of supply, without prejudice to point (b) of Article 8(2). If, under national law, the trader is only liable for a lack of conformity that becomes apparent within a period of time after supply, that period shall not be less than two years from the time of supply, without prejudice to point (b) of Article 8(2). If, under national law, the rights laid down in Article 14 are also subject or only subject to a limitation period, Member States shall ensure that such limitation period allows the consumer to exercise the remedies laid down in Article 14 for any lack of conformity that exists at the time indicated in the first subparagraph and becomes apparent within the period of time indicated in the second subparagraph. 3. Where the contract provides for continuous supply over a period of time, the trader shall be liable for a lack of conformity under Articles 7, 8 and 9, that occurs or becomes apparent within the period of time during which the digital content or digital service is to be supplied under the contract. If, under national law, the rights laid down in Article 14 are also subject or only subject to a limitation period, Member States shall ensure that such limitation period allows the consumer to exercise the remedies laid down in Article 14 for any lack of conformity that occurs or becomes apparent during the period of time referred to in the first subparagraph. Article 12 Burden of proof 1. The burden of proof with regard to whether the digital content or digital service was supplied in accordance with Article 5 shall be on the trader. 2. In cases referred to in Article 11(2), the burden of proof with regard to whether the supplied digital content or digital service was in conformity at the time of supply shall be on the trader for a lack of conformity which becomes apparent within a period of one year from the time when the digital content or digital service was supplied. 3. In cases referred to in Article 11(3), the burden of proof with regard to whether the digital content or digital service was in conformity within the period of time during which the digital content or digital service is to be supplied under the contract shall be on the trader for a lack of conformity which becomes apparent within that period. 4. Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply where the trader demonstrates that the digital environment of the consumer is not compatible with the technical requirements of the digital content or digital service and where the trader informed the consumer of such requirements in a clear and comprehensible manner before the conclusion of the contract. 5. The consumer shall cooperate with the trader, to the extent reasonably possible and necessary, to ascertain whether the cause of the lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service at the time specified in Article 11(2) or (3), as applicable, lay in the consumer's digital environment. The obligation to cooperate shall be limited to the technically available means which are least intrusive for the consumer. Where the consumer fails to cooperate, and where the trader informed the consumer of such requirement in a clear and comprehensible manner before the conclusion of the contract, the burden of proof with regard to whether the lack of conformity existed at the time specified in Article 11(2) or (3), as applicable, shall be on the consumer. Article 13 Remedy for the failure to supply 1. Where the trader has failed to supply the digital content or digital service in accordance with Article 5, the consumer shall call upon the trader to supply the digital content or digital service. If the trader then fails to supply the digital content or digital service without undue delay, or within an additional period of time, as expressly agreed to by the parties, the consumer shall be entitled to terminate the contract. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply, and the consumer shall be entitled to terminate the contract immediately, where: (a) the trader has declared, or it is equally clear from the circumstances, that the trader will not supply the digital content or digital service; (b) the consumer and the trader have agreed, or it is clear from the circumstances attending the conclusion of the contract, that a specific time for the supply is essential for the consumer and the trader fails to supply the digital content or digital service by or at that time. 3. Where the consumer terminates the contract under paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article, Articles 15 to 18 shall apply accordingly. Article 14 Remedies for lack of conformity 1. In the case of a lack of conformity, the consumer shall be entitled to have the digital content or digital service brought into conformity, to receive a proportionate reduction in the price, or to terminate the contract, under the conditions set out in this Article. 2. The consumer shall be entitled to have the digital content or digital service brought into conformity, unless this would be impossible or would impose costs on the trader that would be disproportionate, taking into account all the circumstances of the case including: (a) the value the digital content or digital service would have if there were no lack of conformity; and (b) the significance of the lack of conformity. 3. The trader shall bring the digital content or digital service into conformity pursuant to paragraph 2 within a reasonable time from the time the trader has been informed by the consumer about the lack of conformity, free of charge and without any significant inconvenience to the consumer, taking account of the nature of the digital content or digital service and the purpose for which the consumer required the digital content or digital service. 4. The consumer shall be entitled to either a proportionate reduction of the price in accordance with paragraph 5 where the digital content or digital service is supplied in exchange for a payment of a price, or the termination of the contract in accordance with paragraph 6, in any of the following cases: (a) the remedy to bring the digital content or digital service into conformity is impossible or disproportionate in accordance with paragraph 2; (b) the trader has not brought the digital content or digital service into conformity in accordance with paragraph 3; (c) a lack of conformity appears despite the trader's attempt to bring the digital content or digital service into conformity; (d) the lack of conformity is of such a serious nature as to justify an immediate price reduction or termination of the contract; or (e) the trader has declared, or it is clear from the circumstances, that the trader will not bring the digital content or digital service into conformity within a reasonable time, or without significant inconvenience for the consumer. 5. The reduction in price shall be proportionate to the decrease in the value of the digital content or digital service which was supplied to the consumer compared to the value that the digital content or digital service would have if it were in conformity. Where the contract stipulates that the digital content or digital service shall be supplied over a period of time in exchange for the payment of a price, the reduction in price shall apply to the period of time during which the digital content or digital service was not in conformity. 6. Where the digital content or digital service is supplied in exchange for the payment of a price, the consumer shall be entitled to terminate the contract only if the lack of conformity is not minor. The burden of proof with regard to whether the lack of conformity is minor shall be on the trader. Article 15 Exercise of the right of termination The consumer shall exercise the right to terminate the contract by means of a statement to the trader expressing the decision to terminate the contract. Article 16 Obligations of the trader in the event of termination 1. In the event of termination of the contract, the trader shall reimburse the consumer for all sums paid under the contract. However, in cases where the contract provides for the supply of the digital content or digital service in exchange for a payment of a price and over a period of time, and the digital content or digital service had been in conformity for a period of time prior to the termination of the contract, the trader shall reimburse the consumer only for the proportionate part of the price paid corresponding to the period of time during which the digital content or digital service was not in conformity, and any part of the price paid by the consumer in advance for any period of the contract that would have remained had the contract not been terminated. 2. In respect of personal data of the consumer, the trader shall comply with the obligations applicable under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 3. The trader shall refrain from using any content other than personal data, which was provided or created by the consumer when using the digital content or digital service supplied by the trader, except where such content: (a) has no utility outside the context of the digital content or digital service supplied by the trader; (b) only relates to the consumer's activity when using the digital content or digital service supplied by the trader; (c) has been aggregated with other data by the trader and cannot be disaggregated or only with disproportionate efforts; or (d) has been generated jointly by the consumer and others, and other consumers are able to continue to make use of the content. 4. Except in the situations referred to in point (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 3, the trader shall, at the request of the consumer, make available to the consumer any content other than personal data, which was provided or created by the consumer when using the digital content or digital service supplied by the trader. The consumer shall be entitled to retrieve that digital content free of charge, without hindrance from the trader, within a reasonable time and in a commonly used and machine-readable format. 5. The trader may prevent any further use of the digital content or digital service by the consumer, in particular by making the digital content or digital service inaccessible to the consumer or disabling the user account of the consumer, without prejudice to paragraph 4. Article 17 Obligations of the consumer in the event of termination 1. After the termination of the contract, the consumer shall refrain from using the digital content or digital service and from making it available to third parties. 2. Where the digital content was supplied on a tangible medium, the consumer shall, at the request and at the expense of the trader, return the tangible medium to the trader without undue delay. If the trader decides to request the return of the tangible medium, that request shall be made within 14 days of the day on which the trader is informed of the consumer's decision to terminate the contract. 3. The consumer shall not be liable to pay for any use made of the digital content or digital service in the period, prior to the termination of the contract, during which the digital content or the digital service was not in conformity. Article 18 Time limits and means of reimbursement by the trader 1. Any reimbursement that is owed to the consumer by the trader, pursuant to Article 14(4) and (5) or 16(1), due to a price reduction or termination of the contract shall be carried out without undue delay and, in any event, within 14 days of the date on which the trader is informed of the consumer's decision to invoke the consumer's right for a price reduction or to terminate the contract. 2. The trader shall carry out the reimbursement using the same means of payment as the consumer used to pay for the digital content or digital service, unless the consumer expressly agrees otherwise, and provided that the consumer does not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement. 3. The trader shall not impose any fee on the consumer in respect of the reimbursement. Article 19 Modification of the digital content or digital service 1. Where the contract provides that the digital content or digital service is to be supplied or made accessible to the consumer over a period of time, the trader may modify the digital content or digital service beyond what is necessary to maintain the digital content or digital service in conformity in accordance with Articles 7 and 8, if the following conditions are met: (a) the contract allows, and provides a valid reason for, such a modification; (b) such a modification is made without additional cost to the consumer; (c) the consumer is informed in a clear and comprehensible manner of the modification; and (d) in the cases referred to in paragraph 2, the consumer is informed reasonably in advance on a durable medium of the features and time of the modification and of the right to terminate the contract in accordance with paragraph 2, or of the possibility to maintain the digital content or digital service without such a modification in accordance with paragraph 4. 2. The consumer shall be entitled to terminate the contract if the modification negatively impacts the consumer's access to or use of the digital content or digital service, unless such negative impact is only minor. In that case, the consumer shall be entitled to terminate the contract free of charge within 30 days of the receipt of the information or of the time when the digital content or digital service has been modified by the trader, whichever is later. 3. Where the consumer terminates the contract in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, Articles 15 to 18 shall apply accordingly. 4. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall not apply if the trader has enabled the consumer to maintain without additional cost the digital content or digital service without the modification, and the digital content or digital service remains in conformity. Article 20 Right of redress Where the trader is liable to the consumer because of any failure to supply the digital content or digital service, or because of a lack of conformity resulting from an act or omission by a person in previous links of the chain of transactions, the trader shall be entitled to pursue remedies against the person or persons liable in the chain of commercial transactions. The person against whom the trader may pursue remedies, and the relevant actions and conditions of exercise, shall be determined by national law. Article 21 Enforcement 1. Member States shall ensure that adequate and effective means exist to ensure compliance with this Directive. 2. The means referred to in paragraph 1 shall include provisions whereby one or more of the following bodies, as determined by national law, may take action under national law before the courts or before the competent administrative bodies to ensure that the national provisions transposing this Directive are applied: (a) public bodies or their representatives; (b) consumer organisations having a legitimate interest in protecting consumers; (c) professional organisations having a legitimate interest in acting; (d) not-for-profit bodies, organisations or associations, active in the field of the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms as defined in Article 80 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Article 22 Mandatory nature 1. Unless otherwise provided for in this Directive, any contractual term which, to the detriment of the consumer, excludes the application of the national measures transposing this Directive, derogates from them or varies their effects before the failure to supply or the lack of conformity is brought to the trader's attention by the consumer, or before the modification of the digital content or digital service in accordance with Article 19 is brought to the consumer's attention by the trader, shall not be binding on the consumer. 2. This Directive shall not prevent the trader from offering the consumer contractual arrangements that go beyond the protection provided for in this Directive.

The Digital Single Market Strategy lays down a comprehensive framework facilitating the integration of the digital dimension into the internal market. The first pillar of the Digital Single Market Strategy tackles fragmentation in intra-EU trade by looking at all major obstacles to the development of cross-border e-commerce, which constitutes the most significant part of cross-border business-to-consumer sales of goods. (2) Article 26(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that the Union is to adopt measures with the aim of establishing or ensuring the functioning of the internal market, which is to comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods and services is ensured. Article 169(1) and point (a) of Article 169(2) TFEU provide that the Union is to contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection through measures adopted pursuant to Article 114 TFEU in the context of the completion of the internal market. Ã ¤his Directive aims to strike the right balance between achieving a high level of consumer protection and promoting the competitiveness of enterprises, while ensuring respect for the principle of subsidiarity. (3) Certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods should be harmonised, taking as a base a high level of consumer protection, in order to achieve a genuine digital single market, increase legal certainty and reduce transaction costs, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). (4) E-commerce is a key driver for growth within the internal market. However, its growth potential is far from being fully exploited. In order to strengthen Union competitiveness and to boost growth, the Union needs to act swiftly and encourage economic actors to unleash the full potential offered by the internal market. The full potential of the internal market can only be unleashed if all market participants enjoy smooth access to cross-border sales of goods including in e-commerce transactions. The contract law rules on the basis of which market participants conclude transactions are among the key factors shaping business decisions as to whether to offer goods cross-border. Those rules also influence consumers' willingness to embrace and trust this type of purchase. (5) Technological evolution has led to a growing market for goods that incorporate or are inter-connected with digital content or digital services. Due to the increasing number of such devices and their rapidly growing uptake by consumers, action at Union level is needed in order to ensure that there is a high level of consumer protection and to increase legal certainty as regards the rules applicable to contracts for the sale of such products. Increasing legal certainty would help to reinforce the trust of consumers and sellers. (6) Union rules applicable to the sales of goods are still fragmented, although rules on delivery conditions and, as regards distance or off-premises contracts, pre-contractual information requirements and the right of withdrawal have already been fully harmonised by Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). Other key contractual elements, such as the conformity criteria, the remedies for a lack of conformity with the contract and the main modalities for their exercise, are currently subject to minimum harmonisation under Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). Member States have been allowed to go beyond the Union standards and introduce or maintain rules that ensure that an even higher level of consumer protection is achieved. In doing so, they have acted on different elements and to different extents. Thus, national provisions transposing Directive 1999/44/EC significantly diverge today on essential elements, such as the absence or existence of a hierarchy of remedies. (7) Existing disparities can adversely affect businesses and consumers. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), businesses directing their activities to consumers in other Member States are required to take account of the mandatory consumer contract law rules of the consumer's country of habitual residence. As those rules differ among Member States, businesses can be faced with additional costs. Consequently, many businesses might prefer to continue trading domestically or only export to one or two Member States. That choice of minimising exposure to costs and risks associated with cross-border trade results in lost opportunities for commercial expansion and economies of scale. SMEs in particular, are affected. (8) While consumers enjoy a high level of protection when they purchase from abroad as a result of the application of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008, legal fragmentation also negatively affects consumers' levels of confidence in cross-border transactions. While several factors contribute to this mistrust, uncertainty about key contractual rights ranks prominently among consumers' concerns. This uncertainty exists independently of whether or not consumers are protected by the mandatory consumer contract law rules of their own Member State in the event that sellers direct their cross-border activities to them, or of whether or not consumers conclude cross-border contracts with sellers without the respective seller pursuing commercial activities in the consumer's Member State. (9) While online sales of goods constitute the vast majority of cross-border sales in the Union, differences in national contract laws equally affect retailers using distance sales channels and retailers selling face-to-face and prevent them from expanding across borders. This Directive should cover all sales channels, in order to create a level playing field for all businesses selling goods to consumers. By laying down uniform rules across sales channels, this Directive should avoid any divergence that would create disproportionate burdens for the growing number of omni-channel retailers in the Union. The need for retaining consistent rules on sales and guarantees for all sales channels was confirmed in the Commission's Fitness Check on consumer and marketing law published on 29 May 2017, which also covered Directive 1999/44/EC. (10) This Directive should cover rules applicable to the sales of goods, including goods with digital elements, only in relation to key contract elements needed to overcome contract-law related barriers in the internal market. For this purpose, rules on requirements for conformity, remedies available to consumers for a lack of conformity of the goods with the contract and on the main modalities for their exercise should be fully harmonised, and the level of consumer protection, as compared to Directive 1999/44/EC, should be increased. Fully harmonised rules on some essential elements of consumer contract law would make it easier for businesses, especially SMEs, to offer their products in other Member States. Consumers would benefit from a high level of consumer protection and welfare gains by fully harmonising key rules. (11) This Directive complements Directive 2011/83/EU. While Directive 2011/83/EU mainly lays down provisions regarding pre-contractual information requirements, the right of withdrawal from distance and off-premises contracts and rules on delivery and passing of risk, this Directive introduces rules on conformity of the goods, remedies in the event of a lack of conformity and modalities for their exercise. (12) This Directive should only apply to tangible movable items that constitute goods within the meaning laid down in this Directive. Member States should therefore be free to regulate contracts for the sale of immovable property, such as residential buildings, and its main components intended to constitute a major part of such immovable property. (13) This Directive and Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) should complement each other. While Directive (EU) 2019/770 lays down rules on certain requirements concerning contracts for the supply of digital content or digital services, this Directive lays down rules on certain requirements concerning contracts for the sale of goods. Accordingly, in order to meet the expectations of consumers and ensure a clear-cut and simple legal framework for traders of digital content or digital services, Directive (EU) 2019/770 applies to the supply of digital content or digital services, including digital content supplied on a tangible medium, such as DVDs, CDs, USB sticks and memory cards, as well as to the tangible medium itself, provided that the tangible medium serves exclusively as a carrier of the digital content. In contrast, this Directive should apply to contracts for the sale of goods, including goods with digital elements which require digital content or a digital service in order to perform their functions. (14) The term goods as provided for under this Directive should be understood to include goods with digital elements, and therefore to also refer to any digital content or digital service that is incorporated in or inter-connected with such goods, in such a way that the absence of that digital content or digital service would prevent the goods from performing their functions. Digital content that is incorporated in or inter-connected with a good can be any data which are produced and supplied in digital form, such as operating systems, applications and any other software. Digital content can be pre-installed at the moment of the conclusion of the sales contract or, where that contract so provides, can be installed subsequently. Digital services inter-connected with a good can include services which allow the creation, processing or storage of data in digital form, or access thereto, such as software-as-a-service offered in the cloud computing environment, the continuous supply of traffic data in a navigation system, or the continuous supply of individually adapted training plans in the case of a smart watch. (15) This Directive should apply to contracts for the sale of goods, including goods with digital elements where the absence of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service would prevent the goods from performing their functions and where that digital content or service is provided with the goods under the sales contract concerning those goods. Whether the supply of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service forms part of the sales contract with the seller should depend on the content of this contract. This should include incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital services the supply of which is explicitly required by the contract. It should also include sales contracts which can be understood as covering the supply of specific digital content or a specific digital service because they are normal for goods of the same type and the consumer could reasonably expect them given the nature of the goods and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of the seller or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, including the producer. If, for example, a smart TV were advertised as including a particular video application, that video application would be considered to be part of the sales contract. This should apply regardless of whether the digital content or digital service is pre-installed in the good itself or has to be downloaded subsequently on another device and is only inter-connected to the good. For example, a smart phone could come with a standardised pre-installed application provided under the sales contract, such as an alarm application or a camera application. Another possible example is that of a smart watch. In such a case, the watch itself would be considered to be the good with digital elements, which can perform its functions only with an application that is provided under the sales contract but has to be downloaded by the consumer onto a smart phone; the application would then be the inter-connected digital element. This should also apply if the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service is not supplied by the seller itself but is supplied, under the sales contract, by a third party. In order to avoid uncertainty for both sellers and consumers, in the event of doubt as to whether the supply of the digital content or the digital service forms part of the sales contract, the rules of this Directive should apply. Furthermore, ascertaining a bilateral contractual relationship, between the seller and the consumer, of which the supply of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service forms part should not be affected by the mere fact that the consumer has to consent to a licensing agreement with a third party in order to benefit from the digital content or the digital service. (16) In contrast, if the absence of the incorporated or inter-connected digital content or digital service does not prevent the goods from performing their functions, or if the consumer concludes a contract for the supply of digital content or a digital service which does not form part of the contract concerning the sale of goods with digital elements, that contract should be considered to be separate from the contract for the sale of the goods, even if the seller acts as an intermediary of that second contract with the third-party supplier, and could fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2019/770 if the conditions of that Directive are met. For instance, if the consumer downloads a game application from an app store onto a smart phone, the contract for the supply of the game application is separate from the contract for the sale of the smart phone itself. This Directive should therefore only apply to the sales contract concerning the smart phone, while the supply of the game application should fall under Directive (EU) 2019/770, if the conditions of that Directive are met. Another example would be where it is expressly agreed that the consumer buys a smart phone without a specific operating system and the consumer subsequently concludes a contract for the supply of an operating system from a third party. In such a case, the supply of the separately bought operating system would not form part of the sales contract and therefore would not fall within the scope of this Directive but could fall within the scope of Directive (EU) 2019/770, if the conditions of that Directive are met. (17) For the purpose of legal clarity this Directive should lay down a definition of a sales contract and also clearly define its scope. The scope of this Directive should also cover contracts for goods that are yet to be produced or manufactured, including under the consumer's specifications. Furthermore, an installation of the goods could fall within the scope of this Directive if the installation forms part of the sales contract and has to be carried out by the seller or under the seller's responsibility. Where a contract includes elements of both sales of goods and provision of services, it should be left to national law to determine whether the whole contract can be classified as a sales contract within the meaning of this Directive. (18) This Directive should not affect national law to the extent that the matters concerned are not regulated by this Directive, in particular with regard to the legality of the goods, damages and general contract law aspects such as the formation, validity, nullity or effects of contracts. The same should apply in relation to the consequences of the termination of the contract and to certain aspects regarding repair and replacement that are not regulated in this Directive. When regulating the rights of parties to withhold the performance of their obligations or part thereof until the other party performs its obligations, Member States should remain free to regulate the conditions and modalities regarding the withholding of payment of the price by the consumer. Member States should also remain free to regulate the consumer's entitlement to compensation for damage suffered as a consequence of an infringement by the seller of this Directive. This Directive should also not affect national rules that do not specifically concern consumer contracts and provide for specific remedies for certain types of defects that were not apparent at the time of conclusion of the sales contract, namely national provisions which may lay down specific rules for the seller's liability for hidden defects. This Directive should also not affect national laws providing for non-contractual remedies for the consumer, in the event of lack of conformity of goods, against persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, for example manufacturers, or other persons that fulfil the obligations of such persons. (19) This Directive should not affect the freedom of Member States to allow consumers to choose a specific remedy if the lack of conformity of the goods becomes apparent shortly after delivery, namely national provisions which provide for a right for the consumer to reject goods with a defect and to treat the contract as repudiated or ask for immediate replacement, within a specific short period of time after the delivery of the goods, which should not exceed 30 days. (20) Member States should remain free to regulate information obligations of the seller in connection with the conclusion of the contract or the duty of the seller to warn the consumer about, for instance, certain characteristics of the good, the suitability of materials provided by the consumer or possible disadvantages resulting from specific requests of the consumer, for example a request by the consumer to use a specific fabric for the tailoring of a ball gown. (21) Member States should also remain free to extend the application of the rules of this Directive to contracts that are excluded from the scope of this Directive, or to otherwise regulate such contracts. For instance, Member States should remain free to extend the protection afforded to consumers by this Directive also to natural or legal persons that are not consumers within the meaning of this Directive, such as non-governmental organisations, start-ups or SMEs. (22) The definition of a consumer should cover natural persons who are acting outside their trade, business, craft or profession. However, Member States should also remain free to determine in the case of dual purpose contracts, where the contract is concluded for purposes that are partly within and partly outside the person's trade, and where the trade purpose is so limited as not to be predominant in the overall context of the contract, whether, and under which conditions, that person should also be considered a consumer. (23) This Directive should apply to any contract whereby the seller transfers or undertakes to transfer the ownership of goods to the consumer. Platform providers could be considered to be sellers under this Directive if they act for purposes relating to their own business and as the direct contractual partner of the consumer for the sale of goods. Member States should remain free to extend the application of this Directive to platform providers that do not fulfil the requirements for being considered a seller under this Directive. (24) In order to balance the need for legal certainty with an appropriate flexibility of the legal rules, any reference in this Directive to what can be expected from or by a person should be understood as a reference to what can reasonably be expected. The standard of reasonableness should be objectively ascertained, having regard to the nature and purpose of the contract, the circumstances of the case and to the usages and practices of the parties involved. (25) In order to provide clarity as to what a consumer can expect from the goods and what the seller would be liable for in the event of failure to deliver what is expected, it is essential to fully harmonise rules for determining whether goods are in conformity. Any reference to conformity in this Directive should refer to conformity of the goods with the sales contract. In order to safeguard the legitimate interests of both parties to a sales contract, conformity should be assessed based on both subjective and objective requirements for conformity. (26) Therefore, the goods should comply with the requirements agreed between the seller and the consumer in the sales contract. Such requirements could cover, inter alia, the quantity, quality, type and description of the goods, their fitness for a specific purpose, as well as the delivery of the goods with the agreed accessories and any instructions. The requirements in the sales contract should include those resulting from pre-contractual information which, in accordance with Directive 2011/83/EU, forms an integral part of the sales contract. (27) The notion of functionality should be understood to refer to the ways in which the goods can perform their functions having regard to their purpose. The notion of interoperability relates to whether and to what extent the goods are able to function with hardware or software that is different from those with which goods of the same type are normally used. Successful functioning could include, for instance, the ability of the goods to exchange information with such other software or hardware and to use the information exchanged. (28) Given that the digital content or digital services incorporated in or inter-connected with goods are constantly developing, sellers may agree with consumers to provide updates for such goods. Updates, as agreed in the sales contract, can improve and enhance the digital content or digital service element of goods, extend their functionalities, adapt them to technical developments, protect them against new security threats or serve other purposes. The conformity of goods with digital content or digital services which are incorporated in or inter-connected with the goods should, therefore, also be assessed in relation to whether the digital content or digital service element of such goods is updated in accordance with the sales contract. Failure to supply updates that had been agreed in the sales contract should be considered as a lack of conformity of the goods. Moreover, defective or incomplete updates should also be considered as a lack of conformity of the goods, given that that would mean that such updates are not performed in the manner stipulated in the sales contract. (29) In order to be in conformity, the goods should not only comply with the subjective requirements for conformity but should in addition comply with the objective requirements for conformity set out in this Directive. Conformity should be assessed, inter alia, by considering the purpose for which goods of the same type would normally be used, whether they are supplied with the accessories and instructions that the consumer can reasonably expect to receive or whether they correspond to the sample or model that the seller made available to the consumer. The goods should also possess the qualities and features which are normal for goods of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect, given the nature of the goods and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of the seller or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions. (30) In addition to contractually agreed updates, the seller should also provide updates, including security updates, in order to ensure that goods with digital elements remain in conformity. The seller's obligation should be limited to updates which are necessary for such goods to maintain their conformity with the objective and subjective requirements for conformity laid down in this Directive. Unless the parties have contractually agreed otherwise, the seller should not be obliged to provide upgraded versions of the digital content or digital service of the goods or to improve or extend the functionalities of goods beyond the conformity requirements. If an update provided by the seller, or by a third party supplying the digital content or digital service under the sales contract, causes a lack of conformity of the good with digital elements, the seller should be liable for bringing the good into conformity again. The consumer should remain free to choose whether to install the updates provided. Where the consumer decides not to install the updates which are necessary for the goods with digital elements to maintain their conformity, the consumer should however not expect such goods to remain in conformity. The seller should inform the consumer that the consumer's decision not to install updates which are necessary for keeping the goods with digital elements in conformity, including security updates, will affect the seller's liability for conformity of those features of the goods with digital elements which the relevant updates are supposed to maintain in conformity. This Directive should not affect obligations to provide security updates laid down in other Union law or in national law. (31) In principle, in the case of goods with digital elements whereby the digital content or digital service incorporated in or inter-connected with the goods is supplied through a single act of supply, the seller should only be liable for a lack of conformity that exists at the time of delivery. However, the obligation to provide updates should reflect the fact that the digital environment of any such good constantly changes. Therefore, updates are a necessary tool in order to ensure that the goods are able to function in the same way that they did at the time of delivery. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional goods, goods with digital elements are not completely separate from the seller's sphere because the seller, or a third person supplying the digital content or digital service under the sales contract, is able to update the goods from a distance, usually over the internet. Therefore, if the digital content or digital service is supplied by a single act of supply, the seller should be liable to provide the updates necessary to keep the goods with digital elements in conformity for a period of time that the consumer can reasonably expect, even if the goods were in conformity at the time of delivery. The period of time during which the consumer can reasonably expect to receive updates should be assessed based on the type and purpose of the goods and the digital elements, and taking into account the circumstances and nature of the sales contract. A consumer would normally expect to receive updates for at least as long as the period during which the seller is liable for a lack of conformity, while in some cases the consumer's reasonable expectation could extend beyond that period, as might be the case particularly with regard to security updates. In other cases, for instance as regards goods with digital elements the purpose of which is limited in time, the seller's obligation to provide updates would normally be limited to that time. (32) Ensuring longer durability of goods is important for achieving more sustainable consumption patterns and a circular economy. Similarly, keeping non-compliant products out of the Union market by strengthening market surveillance and providing the right incentives to economic operators is essential in order to increase trust in the functioning of the internal market. For those purposes, product-specific Union legislation is the most appropriate means of introducing durability and other product-related requirements in relation to specific types or groups of products, using for this purpose adapted criteria. This Directive should therefore be complementary to the objectives pursued in such Union product-specific legislation, and should include durability as an objective criterion for the assessment of conformity of goods. Durability in this Directive should refer to the ability of the goods to maintain their required functions and performance through normal use. In order for goods to be in conformity, they should possess the durability which is normal for goods of the same type and which the consumer can reasonably expect given the nature of the specific goods, including the possible need for reasonable maintenance of the goods, such as the regular inspection or changing of filters in a car, and any public statement made by or on behalf of any person constituting a link in the chain of transactions. The assessment should also take into account all other relevant circumstances, such as the price of the goods and the intensity or frequency of the use that the consumer makes of the goods. In addition, insofar as specific durability information is indicated in any pre-contractual statement which forms part of the sales contract, the consumer should be able to rely on them as a part of the subjective requirements for conformity. (33) Under this Directive, the seller should be obliged to deliver to the consumer goods which are in conformity at the time of delivery. It is possible that sellers would make use of spare parts in order to fulfil their obligation to repair goods in the event of a lack of conformity that existed at the time of delivery. While this Directive should not impose an obligation on sellers to ensure the availability of spare parts throughout a period of time as an objective requirement for conformity, it should not affect other provisions of national law obliging the seller, the producer or other person constituting a link in the chain of transactions, to ensure that spare parts are available or to inform consumers about such availability. (34) A large number of goods have to be installed before they can be used effectively by the consumer. In addition, in the case of goods with digital elements, the installation of the digital content or digital service is usually necessary for the consumer to be able to use such goods in line with their intended purpose. Therefore, any lack of conformity resulting from an incorrect installation of the goods, including from the incorrect installation of the digital content or digital service incorporated in or inter-connected with the goods, should be regarded as a lack of conformity, where the installation was performed by the seller or under the seller's control. Where the goods were intended to be installed by the consumer, a lack of conformity resulting from incorrect installation should be regarded as a lack of conformity of the goods, irrespective of whether the installation was performed by the consumer or by a third party under the consumer's responsibility, if the incorrect installation was due to shortcomings in the installation instructions, such as incompleteness or a lack of clarity making the installation instructions difficult to use for the average consumer. (35) Conformity should cover material defects as well as legal defects. Restrictions resulting from a violation of third-party rights, in particular intellectual property rights, could prevent or limit the use of the goods in accordance with the contract. Member States should ensure that in such cases the consumer is entitled to remedies for the lack of conformity as set out in this Directive, unless national law provides for the nullity of the contract or for its rescission in such cases. (36) In order to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility in the rules, for instance in relation to the sale of second-hand goods, it should be possible for the parties to deviate from the objective requirements for conformity provided for in this Directive. Such a deviation should only be possible if the consumer was specifically informed about it and if the consumer accepts it separately from other statements or agreements, and by way of active and unequivocal conduct. (37) Enhancing legal certainty for both consumers and sellers requires a clear indication of the time when the conformity of the goods should be assessed. The relevant time for assessing the conformity of the goods should be the time when the goods are delivered. This should also apply to goods which incorporate or are inter-connected with digital content or a digital service supplied through a single act of supply. However, where the digital content or digital service incorporated in or inter-connected with the goods is to be supplied continuously over a period of time, the relevant time for the purpose of establishing conformity of that digital content or digital service element should not be one specific moment in time but rather a period of time, starting from the time of delivery. For reasons of legal certainty, that period of time should be equal to the period during which the seller is liable for a lack of conformity. (38) This Directive should not regulate the meaning of delivery, which should be left to national law, in particular, as regards the question of what the seller has to do in order to fulfil the seller's obligation to deliver the goods. Furthermore, references to the time of delivery in this Directive should be without prejudice to the rules on the passing of risk provided for in Directive 2011/83/EU and accordingly implemented in the law of the Member States. (39) Goods with digital elements should be deemed to have been delivered to the consumer when both the physical component of the goods has been delivered and the single act of supply of the digital content or digital service has been performed or the continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period of time has begun. This means that the seller should also make the digital content or digital service available or accessible to the consumer in such a way that the digital content or digital service, or any means suitable for downloading or accessing it, has reached the sphere of the consumer and no further action is required by the seller in order to enable the consumer to use the digital content or digital service in accordance with the contract, for example by providing a link or a download option. Therefore, the relevant moment for establishing conformity should be the time when the digital content or digital service is supplied, if the physical component was delivered earlier. As a result, it can be ensured that there is a uniform starting point for the liability period for the physical component, on the one hand, and for the digital element on the other hand. Moreover, in many cases the consumer is unable to notice a defect in the physical component before the digital content or digital service is supplied. (40) Where goods require installation by the seller, the consumer in certain cases is unable to use the goods or notice a defect before the installation has been completed. Accordingly, where, under the sales contract, the goods are to be installed by the seller or under the seller's responsibility, the goods should be considered to be delivered to the consumer when the installation is complete. (41) In order to ensure that there is legal certainty for sellers and overall consumer confidence in cross-border purchases, it is necessary to provide for a period during which the consumer is entitled to remedies for any lack of conformity that exists at the relevant time for establishing conformity. Given that when implementing Directive 1999/44/EC, a large majority of Member States have provided for a period of two years, and in practice that period is considered reasonable by market participants, that period should be maintained. The same period should apply in the case of goods with digital elements. However, where the contract provides for continuous supply for more than two years, the consumer should be entitled to remedies for any lack of conformity of the digital content or the digital service that occurs or becomes apparent within the period during which the digital content or digital service is to be supplied under the contract. In order to ensure that there is flexibility for Member States to increase the level of consumer protection in their national law, Member States should be free to provide for longer time limits for the liability of the seller than those laid down in this Directive. (42) For reasons of coherence with the existing national legal systems, Member States should be free to provide either that sellers are liable for a lack of conformity that becomes apparent within a specific period of time, possibly coupled with a limitation period, or that consumers' remedies are only subject to a limitation period. In the former case, Member States should ensure that the period for the seller's liability is not circumvented by the limitation period for the consumer's remedies. While this Directive should, therefore, not harmonise the starting point of national limitation periods, it should ensure that such limitation periods do not curtail the consumers' right to exercise their remedies for any lack of conformity which becomes apparent in the period during which the seller is liable for a lack of conformity. In the latter case, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce only a limitation period for the consumer's remedies, without introducing a specific period within which the lack of conformity has to become apparent in order for the seller to be liable. In order to ensure that consumers are equally protected also in such cases, Member States should ensure that where only a limitation period applies, it should still allow consumers to exercise the remedies for any lack of conformity that becomes apparent at least during the period of time provided for in this Directive as a liability period. (43) As regards certain aspects, different treatment of second-hand goods could be justifiable. Although a liability or limitation period of two years or more usually reconciles the interests of both the seller and the consumer, this might not be the case with regard to second-hand goods. Member States should, therefore, be allowed to enable the parties to agree on a shortened liability or limitation period for such goods. Leaving this question to a contractual agreement between the parties increases contractual freedom and ensures that the consumer has to be informed both about the nature of the good as a second-hand good, and the shortened liability or limitation period. However, such a contractually agreed period should not be shorter than one year. (44) This Directive should not regulate the conditions under which the liability period, as provided for in this Directive, or a limitation period can be suspended or interrupted. Member States should, therefore, be able to provide for the suspension or interruption of the liability period or limitation period, for example in the event of repair, replacement or negotiations between the seller and the consumer with a view to an amicable settlement. (45) For a period of one year, or for a period of two years if Member States choose to apply a two-year period, the consumer should only need to prove that the good is not in conformity, without also needing to prove that the lack of conformity actually existed at the relevant time for establishing conformity. In order to rebut the consumer's claim, the seller would need to prove that the lack of conformity did not exist at that time. In addition, in some cases the presumption that the lack of conformity existed at the relevant time for establishing conformity could be incompatible with the nature of the goods or the nature of the lack of conformity. The former could be the case with goods that by nature deteriorate, such as perishable products, for example flowers, or goods which are only intended for a single use. An example of the latter would be a lack of conformity, which can only be a result of an action by the consumer or of an evident external cause which occurred after the goods were delivered to the consumer. In the case of goods with digital elements where the contract provides for continuous supply of the digital content or digital service, the consumer should not have to prove that the digital content or digital service was not in conformity during the respective period of time for establishing conformity. In order to rebut the consumer's claim, the seller would need to prove that the digital content or digital service was in conformity during that period. (46) Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce provisions stipulating that, in order to benefit from the consumer's rights, the consumer has to inform the seller of a lack of conformity within a period not shorter than two months from the date on which the consumer detected such lack of conformity. Member States should be allowed to ensure that consumers have a higher level of protection, by not introducing such an obligation. (47) In order to increase legal certainty and to eliminate one of the major obstacles inhibiting the internal market, this Directive should fully harmonise the remedies available to consumers for lack of conformity of goods, and the conditions under which such remedies can be exercised. In particular, in the event of lack of conformity, consumers should be entitled to have the goods brought into conformity or to receive a proportionate reduction in the price or to terminate the contract. (48) As regards bringing goods into conformity, consumers should enjoy a choice between repair or replacement. Enabling consumers to require repair should encourage sustainable consumption and could contribute to greater durability of products. The consumer's choice between repair and replacement should only be limited where the option chosen would be legally or factually impossible or would impose costs on the seller that would be disproportionate, compared to the other option available. For instance, it might be disproportionate to request the replacement of goods because of a minor scratch, where such replacement would create significant costs and the scratch could easily be repaired. (49) The seller should be allowed to refuse to bring the goods into conformity if both repair and replacement are impossible, or they would impose disproportionate costs on the seller. The same should apply if either repair or replacement is impossible and the alternative remedy would impose disproportionate costs on the seller. For instance, if goods are located in a place that is different from where they were originally delivered, the costs of postage and carriage could become disproportionate for the seller. (50) When a lack of conformity becomes apparent, the consumer should inform the seller about it in order to give the seller the opportunity to bring the good into conformity. The seller should do that within a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, the consumer should not, in principle, be immediately entitled to a price reduction or termination of the contract but should give the seller reasonable time to repair or replace the non-conforming good. If the seller has not repaired or replaced the good within that time, the consumer should be entitled to claim and obtain a price reduction or termination of the contract without waiting any longer. (51) If repair or replacement have not provided the consumer with a proper remedy for the lack of conformity, the consumer should be entitled to a price reduction or to terminate the contract. That should be the case, in particular, where the seller has not completed repair or replacement, or where it is clear from the circumstances that the seller will not complete repair or replacement, or the seller has refused to bring the goods into conformity because repair and replacement are impossible or would impose disproportionate costs on the seller. (52) In certain situations, it could be justified that the consumer should be entitled to have the price reduced or the contract terminated immediately. Where the seller has taken action to bring the goods into conformity but a lack of conformity becomes apparent subsequently, it should be objectively determined whether the consumer should accept further attempts by the seller to bring the goods into conformity, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, such as the type and the value of the goods, and the nature and the significance of the lack of conformity. In particular, for expensive or complex goods it could be justified to allow the seller another attempt to remedy the lack of conformity. It should also be taken into account whether the consumer can be expected to maintain confidence in the ability of the seller to bring the goods into conformity or not, for instance, due to the same problem appearing twice. Similarly, in certain situations, the lack of conformity could be of such a serious nature that the consumer cannot maintain confidence in the ability of the seller to bring the goods into conformity, such as where the lack of conformity severely affects the ability of the consumer to make normal use of the goods and the consumer cannot be expected to trust that repair or replacement by the seller would remedy the problem. (53) In order to maintain a balance between the rights and obligations of the contracting parties, the consumer should enjoy the right to terminate the contract only in cases where the lack of conformity is not minor. (54) Member States should be able to regulate the conditions under which the performance of the debtor can be fulfilled by another person, for example the conditions under which the seller's obligation to repair a good can be performed by the consumer or a third party at the seller's expense. (55) In order to protect consumers against the risk of extended delays, any repair or replacement should be successfully completed within a reasonable period of time. What is considered to be a reasonable time for completing a repair or replacement should correspond to the shortest possible time necessary for completing the repair or replacement. That time should be objectively determined by considering the nature and complexity of the goods, the nature and severity of the lack of conformity, and the effort needed to complete repair or replacement. When implementing this Directive, Member States should be able to interpret the notion of reasonable time for completing repair or replacement, by providing for fixed periods that could generally be considered reasonable for repair or replacement, in particular with regard to specific categories of products. (56) This Directive should not lay down provisions on where the obligations of a debtor have to be performed. This Directive should, therefore, neither specify the place of delivery, nor prescribe where the repair or replacement should take place; such questions should be left to national law. (57) Where the seller brings the good into conformity by replacement, the consumer should not be obliged to pay for the normal use of the goods before they were replaced. The use of the goods should be considered normal if it is in accordance with the nature and purpose of the goods. (58) In order to make the right to terminate effective for consumers, in situations where the consumer acquires multiple goods and the lack of conformity only affects some of the goods delivered under the contract, the consumer should have the right to terminate the contract also in relation to the other goods acquired together with the non-conforming goods, even if those other goods are in conformity, if the consumer cannot reasonably be expected to accept to keep only the conforming goods. (59) Where the consumer terminates the contract due to the lack of conformity, this Directive should prescribe rules only on the main effects of and modalities for the right of termination, in particular the obligation for the parties to return what they have received. Thus, the seller should be obliged to refund the price received from the consumer and the consumer should return the goods. (60) This Directive should not affect the freedom of Member States to regulate the consequences of termination other than those provided for in this Directive, such as the consequences of the decrease of the value of the goods or of their destruction or loss. Member States should also be allowed to regulate the modalities for reimbursement of the price to the consumer, for example the modalities concerning the means to be used for such reimbursement or concerning possible costs and fees incurred as a result of the reimbursement. Member States should, for instance, also have the freedom to provide for certain time limits for the reimbursement of the price or for the return of the goods. (61) The principle of the seller's liability for damages is an essential element of sales contracts. Consumers should, therefore, be entitled to claim compensation for any detriment caused by an infringement by the seller of this Directive, including for damage suffered as a consequence of a lack of conformity. Such compensation should put the consumer as much as possible into the position in which the consumer would have been had the goods been in conformity. As the existence of such a right to damages is already ensured in all Member States, this Directive should be without prejudice to national rules on the compensation of consumers for harm resulting from infringement of those rules. Member States should also remain free to regulate consumers' entitlement to compensation for situations in which the repair or replacement caused significant inconvenience or was delayed. (62) In order to ensure that there is transparency, certain requirements as regards commercial guarantees should be provided, alongside the pre-contractual information requirements on the existence and conditions of commercial guarantees set out in Directive 2011/83/EU. Moreover, in order to improve legal certainty and to avoid consumers being misled, this Directive should provide that, where commercial guarantee conditions contained in associated advertisements are more favourable to the consumer than those included in the guarantee statement, the more advantageous conditions should prevail. Finally, this Directive should provide rules on the content of the guarantee statement and on the way it should be made available to consumers. For instance, the guarantee statement should include the terms of the commercial guarantee and state that the legal guarantee of conformity is unaffected by the commercial guarantee, making it clear that the commercial guarantee terms constitute an undertaking that is additional to the legal guarantee of conformity. Member States should be free to lay down rules on other aspects of commercial guarantees not covered by this Directive, for example on associating debtors other than the guarantor with the commercial guarantee, provided that those rules do not deprive consumers of the protection afforded to them by the fully harmonised provisions of this Directive on commercial guarantees. While Member States should remain free to require that commercial guarantees be provided free of charge, they should ensure that any undertaking by the seller or the producer which falls under the definition of commercial guarantees as set out in this Directive complies with the harmonised rules of this Directive. (63) Considering that the seller is liable towards the consumer for any lack of conformity of the goods resulting from an act or omission of the seller or a third party, the seller should be able to pursue remedies against the person responsible in previous links of the chain of transactions. Such remedies should include those for a lack of conformity which results from the omission of an update, including a security update, which would have been necessary to keep the good with digital elements in conformity. However, this Directive should not affect the principle of freedom of contract between the seller and other parties in the chain of transactions. The details for exercising that right, in particular against whom and how such remedies are to be pursued and whether the remedies are of a mandatory nature, should be provided by the Member States. The question as to whether the consumer can also raise a claim directly against a person in previous links of the chain of transactions should not be regulated by this Directive, except in cases where a producer offers the consumer a commercial guarantee for the goods. (64) Persons or organisations regarded under national law as having a legitimate interest in protecting consumer contractual rights should be afforded the right to initiate proceedings, either before a court or before an administrative authority which is competent to decide upon complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings. (65) Nothing in this Directive should prejudice the application of rules of private international law, in particular Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). (66) Directive 1999/44/EC should be repealed. The date of repeal should be aligned with the transposition date of this Directive. In order to ensure that the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary for Member States to comply with this Directive are applied in a uniform manner to contracts concluded from the transposition date onwards, this Directive should not apply to contracts concluded before its transposition date. (67) The Annex to Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) should be amended to include a reference to this Directive so as to facilitate cross-border cooperation on enforcement of this Directive. (68) Annex I to Directive 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) should be amended to include a reference to this Directive so as to ensure that the collective interests of consumers laid down in this Directive are protected. (69) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (10), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified. (70) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to contribute to the functioning of the internal market by tackling in a consistent manner contract law-related obstacles for the cross-border sales of goods in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, due to the fact that each Member State individually is not in a position to tackle the existing fragmented legal framework by ensuring the coherence of its law with the laws of other Member States, but can rather, by removing the principal contract law-related obstacles through full harmonisation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective. (71) It is appropriate for the Commission to review the application of this Directive five years after its entry into force, including in particular the provisions regarding remedies, the burden of proof  also with respect to second-hand goods as well as goods sold at public auctions  and the producer's commercial guarantee of durability. The Commission should also assess whether the application of this Directive and of Directive (EU) 2019/770 ensures a consistent and coherent legal framework with regard to the supply of digital content or digital services and goods with digital elements. (72) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and freedoms and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including those enshrined in Articles 16, 38 and 47 thereof, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Subject matter and purpose The purpose of this Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market while providing for a high level of consumer protection, by laying down common rules on certain requirements concerning sales contracts concluded between sellers and consumers, in particular rules on the conformity of goods with the contract, remedies in the event of a lack of such conformity, the modalities for the exercise of those remedies, and on commercial guarantees. Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions apply: (1) sales contract means any contract under which the seller transfers or undertakes to transfer ownership of goods to a consumer, and the consumer pays or undertakes to pay the price thereof; (2) consumer means any natural person who, in relation to contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside that person's trade, business, craft or profession; (3) seller means any natural person or any legal person, irrespective of whether privately or publicly owned, that is acting, including through any other person acting in that natural or legal person's name or on that person's behalf, for purposes relating to that person's trade, business, craft or profession, in relation to contracts covered by this Directive; (4) producer means a manufacturer of goods, an importer of goods into the Union or any person purporting to be a producer by placing its name, trade mark or other distinctive sign on the goods; (5) goods means: (a) any tangible movable items; water, gas and electricity are to be considered as goods within the meaning of this Directive where they are put up for sale in a limited volume or a set quantity; (b) any tangible movable items that incorporate or are inter-connected with digital content or a digital service in such a way that the absence of that digital content or digital service would prevent the goods from performing their functions (goods with digital elements); (6) digital content means data which are produced and supplied in digital form; (7) digital service means: (a) a service that allows the consumer to create, process, store or access data in digital form; or (b) a service that allows the sharing of or any other interaction with data in digital form uploaded or created by the consumer or other users of that service; (8) compatibility means the ability of the goods to function with hardware or software with which goods of the same type are normally used, without the need to convert the goods, hardware or software; (9) functionality means the ability of the goods to perform their functions having regard to their purpose; (10) interoperability means the ability of the goods to function with hardware or software different from those with which goods of the same type are normally used; (11) durable medium means any instrument which enables the consumer or the seller to store information addressed personally to that person in a way that is accessible for future reference, for a period of time adequate for the purposes of the information, and which allows the unchanged reproduction of the information stored; (12) commercial guarantee means any undertaking by the seller or a producer (the guarantor) to the consumer, in addition to the seller's legal obligation relating to the guarantee of conformity, to reimburse the price paid or to replace, repair or service goods in any way if they do not meet the specifications or any other requirements not related to conformity set out in the guarantee statement or in the relevant advertising available at the time of, or before the conclusion of the contract; (13) durability means the ability of the goods to maintain their required functions and performance through normal use; (14) free of charge means free of the necessary costs incurred in order to bring the goods into conformity, particularly the cost of postage, carriage, labour or materials; (15) public auction means a method of sale where goods or services are offered by the seller to consumers, who attend or are given the possibility to attend the auction in person, through a transparent, competitive bidding procedure run by an auctioneer and where the successful bidder is bound to purchase the goods or services. Article 3 Scope 1. This Directive shall apply to sales contracts between a consumer and a seller. 2. Contracts between a consumer and a seller for the supply of goods to be manufactured or produced shall also be deemed sales contracts for the purpose of this Directive. 3. This Directive shall not apply to contracts for the supply of digital content or digital services. It shall, however, apply to digital content or digital services which are incorporated in or inter-connected with goods in the meaning of point (5)(b) of Article 2, and are provided with the goods under the sales contract, irrespective of whether such digital content or digital service is supplied by the seller or by a third party. In the event of doubt as to whether the supply of incorporated or inter-connected digital content or an incorporated or inter-connected digital service forms part of the sales contract, the digital content or digital service shall be presumed to be covered by the sales contract. 4. This Directive shall not apply to: (a) any tangible medium which serves exclusively as a carrier for digital content; or (b) any goods sold by way of execution or otherwise by authority of law. 5. Member States may exclude from the scope of this Directive contracts for the sale of: (a) second-hand goods sold at public auction; and (b) living animals. In the case referred to in point (a), clear and comprehensive information that the rights deriving from this Directive do not apply shall be made easily available to consumers. 6. This Directive shall not affect the freedom of Member States to regulate aspects of general contract law, such as rules on the formation, validity, nullity or effects of contracts, including the consequences of the termination of a contract, in so far as they are not regulated in this Directive, or the right to damages. 7. This Directive shall not affect the freedom of Member States to allow consumers to choose a specific remedy, if the lack of conformity of the goods becomes apparent within a period after delivery, not exceeding 30 days. In addition, this Directive shall not affect national rules not specific to consumer contracts providing for specific remedies for certain types of defects that were not apparent at the time of conclusion of the sales contract. Article 4 Level of harmonisation Member States shall not maintain or introduce, in their national law, provisions diverging from those laid down in this Directive, including more, or less, stringent provisions to ensure a different level of consumer protection, unless otherwise provided for in this Directive. Article 5 Conformity of goods The seller shall deliver goods to the consumer that meet the requirements set out in Articles 6, 7 and 8, where applicable, without prejudice to Article 9. Article 6 Subjective requirements for conformity In order to conform with the sales contract, the goods shall, in particular, where applicable: (a) be of the description, type, quantity and quality, and possess the functionality, compatibility, interoperability and other features, as required by the sales contract; (b) be fit for any particular purpose for which the consumer requires them and which the consumer made known to the seller at the latest at the time of the conclusion of the sales contract, and in respect of which the seller has given acceptance; (c) be delivered with all accessories and instructions, including on installation, as stipulated by the sales contract; and (d) be supplied with updates as stipulated by the sales contract. Article 7 Objective requirements for conformity 1. In addition to complying with any subjective requirement for conformity, the goods shall: (a) be fit for the purposes for which goods of the same type would normally be used, taking into account, where applicable, any existing Union and national law, technical standards or, in the absence of such technical standards, applicable sector-specific industry codes of conduct; (b) where applicable, be of the quality and correspond to the description of a sample or model that the seller made available to the consumer before the conclusion of the contract; (c) where applicable, be delivered along with such accessories, including packaging, installation instructions or other instructions, as the consumer may reasonably expect to receive; and (d) be of the quantity and possess the qualities and other features, including in relation to durability, functionality, compatibility and security normal for goods of the same type and which the consumer may reasonably expect given the nature of the goods and taking into account any public statement made by or on behalf of the seller, or other persons in previous links of the chain of transactions, including the producer, particularly in advertising or on labelling. 2. The seller shall not be bound by public statements, as referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 if the seller shows that: (a) the seller was not, and could not reasonably have been, aware of the public statement in question; (b) by the time of conclusion of the contract, the public statement had been corrected in the same way as, or in a way comparable to how, it had been made; or (c) the decision to buy the goods could not have been influenced by the public statement. 3. In the case of goods with digital elements, the seller shall ensure that the consumer is informed of and supplied with updates, including security updates, that are necessary to keep those goods in conformity, for the period of time: (a) that the consumer may reasonably expect given the type and purpose of the goods and the digital elements, and taking into account the circumstances and nature of the contract, where the sales contract provides for a single act of supply of the digital content or digital service; or (b) indicated in Article 10(2) or (5), as applicable, where the sales contract provides for a continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period of time. 4. Where the consumer fails to install within a reasonable time updates supplied in accordance with paragraph 3, the seller shall not be liable for any lack of conformity resulting solely from the lack of the relevant update, provided that: (a) the seller informed the consumer about the availability of the update and the consequences of the failure of the consumer to install it; and (b) the failure of the consumer to install or the incorrect installation by the consumer of the update was not due to shortcomings in the installation instructions provided to the consumer. 5. There shall be no lack of conformity within the meaning of paragraph 1 or 3 if, at the time of the conclusion of the sales contract, the consumer was specifically informed that a particular characteristic of the goods was deviating from the objective requirements for conformity laid down in paragraph 1 or 3 and the consumer expressly and separately accepted that deviation when concluding the sales contract. Article 8 Incorrect installation of the goods Any lack of conformity resulting from the incorrect installation of the goods shall be regarded as lack of conformity of the goods, if: (a) the installation forms part of the sales contract and was carried out by the seller or under the seller's responsibility; or (b) the installation, intended to be carried out by the consumer, was done by the consumer and the incorrect installation was due to shortcomings in the installation instructions provided by the seller or, in the case of goods with digital elements, provided by the seller or by the supplier of the digital content or digital service. Article 9 Third-party rights Where a restriction resulting from a violation of any right of a third party, in particular intellectual property rights, prevents or limits the use of the goods in accordance with Articles 6 and 7, Member States shall ensure that the consumer is entitled to the remedies for lack of conformity provided for in Article 13, unless national law provides for the nullity or rescission of the sales contract in such cases. Article 10 Liability of the seller 1. The seller shall be liable to the consumer for any lack of conformity which exists at the time when the goods were delivered and which becomes apparent within two years of that time. Without prejudice to Article 7(3), this paragraph shall also apply to goods with digital elements. 2. In the case of goods with digital elements, where the sales contract provides for a continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period of time, the seller shall also be liable for any lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service that occurs or becomes apparent within two years of the time when the goods with digital elements were delivered. Where the contract provides for a continuous supply for more than two years, the seller shall be liable for any lack of conformity of the digital content or digital service that occurs or becomes apparent within the period of time during which the digital content or digital service is to be supplied under the sales contract. 3. Member States may maintain or introduce longer time limits than those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. 4. If, under national law, the remedies provided for in Article 13 are also subject to a limitation period, Member States shall ensure that such limitation period allows the consumer to exercise the remedies laid down in Article 13 for any lack of conformity for which the seller is liable pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and which becomes apparent within the period of time referred to in those paragraphs. 5. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, Member States may maintain or introduce only a limitation period for the remedies provided for in Article 13. Member States shall ensure that such limitation period allows the consumer to exercise the remedies laid down in Article 13 for any lack of conformity for which the seller is liable pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and which becomes apparent during the period of time referred to in those paragraphs. 6. Member States may provide that, in the case of second-hand goods, the seller and the consumer can agree to contractual terms or agreements with a shorter liability or limitation period than those referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 5, provided that such shorter periods shall not be less than one year. Article 11 Burden of proof 1. Any lack of conformity which becomes apparent within one year of the time when the goods were delivered shall be presumed to have existed at the time when the goods were delivered, unless proved otherwise or unless this presumption is incompatible with the nature of the goods or with the nature of the lack of conformity. This paragraph shall also apply to goods with digital elements. 2. Instead of the one-year period laid down in paragraph 1, Member States may maintain or introduce a period of two years from the time when the goods were delivered. 3. In the case of goods with digital elements where the sales contract provides for the continuous supply of the digital content or digital service over a period of time, the burden of proof with regard to whether the digital content or digital service was in conformity within the period of time referred to in Article 10(2) shall be on the seller for a lack of conformity which becomes apparent within the period of time referred to in that Article. Article 12 Obligation to notify Member States may maintain or introduce provisions stipulating that, in order to benefit from the consumer's rights, the consumer has to inform the seller of a lack of conformity within a period of at least 2 months of the date on which the consumer detected such lack of conformity. Article 13 Remedies for lack of conformity 1. In the event of a lack of conformity, the consumer shall be entitled to have the goods brought into conformity or to receive a proportionate reduction in the price, or to terminate the contract, under the conditions set out in this Article. 2. In order to have the goods brought into conformity, the consumer may choose between repair and replacement, unless the remedy chosen would be impossible or, compared to the other remedy, would impose costs on the seller that would be disproportionate, taking into account all circumstances, including: (a) the value the goods would have if there were no lack of conformity; (b) the significance of the lack of conformity; and (c) whether the alternative remedy could be provided without significant inconvenience to the consumer. 3. The seller may refuse to bring the goods into conformity if repair and replacement are impossible or would impose costs on the seller that would be disproportionate, taking into account all circumstances including those mentioned in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2. 4. The consumer shall be entitled to either a proportionate reduction of the price in accordance with Article 15 or the termination of the sales contract in accordance with Article 16 in any of the following cases: (a) the seller has not completed repair or replacement or, where applicable, has not completed repair or replacement in accordance with Article 14(2) and (3), or the seller has refused to bring the goods into conformity in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article; (b) a lack of conformity appears despite the seller having attempted to bring the goods into conformity; (c) the lack of conformity is of such a serious nature as to justify an immediate price reduction or termination of the sales contract; or (d) the seller has declared, or it is clear from the circumstances, that the seller will not bring the goods into conformity within a reasonable time, or without significant inconvenience for the consumer. 5. The consumer shall not be entitled to terminate the contract if the lack of conformity is only minor. The burden of proof with regard to whether the lack of conformity is minor shall be on the seller. 6. The consumer shall have the right to withhold payment of any outstanding part of the price or a part thereof until the seller has fulfilled the seller's obligations under this Directive. Member States may determine the conditions and modalities for the consumer to exercise the right to withhold the payment. 7. Member States may regulate whether and to what extent a contribution of the consumer to the lack of conformity affects the consumer's right to remedies. Article 14 Repair or replacement of the goods 1. Repairs or replacements shall be carried out: (a) free of charge; (b) within a reasonable period of time from the moment the seller has been informed by the consumer about the lack of conformity; and (c) without any significant inconvenience to the consumer, taking into account the nature of the goods and the purpose for which the consumer required the goods. 2. Where the lack of conformity is to be remedied by repair or replacement of the goods, the consumer shall make the goods available to the seller. The seller shall take back the replaced goods at the seller's expense. 3. Where a repair requires the removal of goods that had been installed in a manner consistent with their nature and purpose before the lack of conformity became apparent, or where such goods are to be replaced, the obligation to repair or replace the goods shall include the removal of the non-conforming goods, and the installation of replacement goods or repaired goods, or bearing the costs of that removal and installation. 4. The consumer shall not be liable to pay for normal use made of the replaced goods during the period prior to their replacement. Article 15 Price reduction The reduction of price shall be proportionate to the decrease in the value of the goods which were received by the consumer compared to the value the goods would have if they were in conformity. Article 16 Termination of the sales contract 1. The consumer shall exercise the right to terminate the sales contract by means of a statement to the seller expressing the decision to terminate the sales contract. 2. Where the lack of conformity relates to only some of the goods delivered under the sales contract and there is a ground for termination of the sales contract pursuant to Article 13, the consumer may terminate the sales contract only in relation to those goods, and in relation to any other goods which the consumer acquired together with the non-conforming goods if the consumer cannot reasonably be expected to accept to keep only the conforming goods. 3. Where the consumer terminates a sales contract as a whole or, in accordance with paragraph 2, in relation to some of the goods delivered under the sales contract: (a) the consumer shall return to the seller, at the seller's expense, the goods; and (b) the seller shall reimburse to the consumer the price paid for the goods upon receipt of the goods or of evidence provided by the consumer of having sent back the goods. For the purposes of this paragraph, Member States may determine the modalities for return and reimbursement. Article 17 Commercial guarantees 1. Any commercial guarantee shall be binding on the guarantor under the conditions laid down in the commercial guarantee statement and associated advertising available at the time, or before the conclusion, of the contract. Under the conditions laid down in this Article and without prejudice to any other applicable provisions of Union or national law, where a producer offers to the consumer a commercial guarantee of durability for certain goods for a certain period of time, the producer shall be liable directly to the consumer, during the entire period of the commercial guarantee of durability for repair or replacement of the goods in accordance with Article 14. The producer may offer to the consumer more favourable conditions in the commercial guarantee of durability statement. If the conditions laid out in the commercial guarantee statement are less advantageous to the consumer than those laid down in the associated advertising, the commercial guarantee shall be binding under the conditions laid down in the advertising relating to the commercial guarantee, unless, before the conclusion of the contract, the associated advertising was corrected in the same way or in a comparable way to that in which it was made. 2. The commercial guarantee statement shall be provided to the consumer on a durable medium at the latest at the time of the delivery of the goods. The commercial guarantee statement shall be expressed in plain, intelligible language. It shall include the following: (a) a clear statement that the consumer is entitled by law to remedies from the seller free of charge in the event of a lack of conformity of the goods and that those remedies are not affected by the commercial guarantee; (b) the name and address of the guarantor; (c) the procedure to be followed by the consumer to obtain the implementation of the commercial guarantee; (d) the designation of the goods to which the commercial guarantee applies; and (e) the terms of the commercial guarantee. 3. Non-compliance with paragraph 2 shall not affect the binding nature of the commercial guarantee for the guarantor. 4. Member States may lay down rules on other aspects concerning commercial guarantees which are not regulated in this Article, including rules on the language or languages in which the commercial guarantee statement is to be made available to the consumer. Article 18 Right of redress Where the seller is liable to the consumer because of a lack of conformity resulting from an act or omission, including omitting to provide updates to goods with digital elements in accordance with Article 7(3), by a person in previous links of the chain of transactions, the seller shall be entitled to pursue remedies against the person or persons liable in the chain of transactions. The person against whom the seller may pursue remedies and the relevant actions and conditions of exercise, shall be determined by national law. Article 19 Enforcement 1. Member States shall ensure that adequate and effective means exist to ensure compliance with this Directive. 2. The means referred to in paragraph 1 shall include provisions whereby one or more of the following bodies, as determined by national law, may take action under national law before the courts or before the competent administrative bodies to ensure that the national provisions transposing this Directive are applied: (a) public bodies or their representatives; (b) consumer organisations having a legitimate interest in protecting consumers; (c) professional organisations having a legitimate interest in acting. Article 20 Consumer information Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that information on the rights of consumers under this Directive, and on the means to enforce those rights, are available to consumers. Article 21 Mandatory nature 1. Unless otherwise provided for in this Directive, any contractual agreement which, to the detriment of the consumer, excludes the application of national measures transposing this Directive, derogates from them, or varies their effect, before the lack of conformity of the goods is brought to the seller's attention by the consumer, shall not be binding on the consumer. 2. This Directive shall not prevent the seller from offering to the consumer contractual arrangements that go beyond the protection provided for in this Directive. Article 22 Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 and Directive 2009/22/EC (1) In the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, point 3 is replaced by the following: 3.

(2) Fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment also represent obstacles to the digital single market, as they erode consumers' trust and cause direct economic loss. (3) Council Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA (3) needs to be updated and complemented in order to include further provisions on offences in particular with regard to computer-related fraud, and on penalties, prevention, assistance to victims and cross-border cooperation. (4) Significant gaps and differences in Member States' laws in the areas of fraud and of counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment can obstruct the prevention, detection and sanctioning of those types of crime and other serious and organised crimes related to and enabled by them, and make police and judicial cooperation more complicated and therefore less effective, with negative consequences for security. (5) Fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment have a significant cross-border dimension, accentuated by an increasing digital component, which underlines the need for further action to approximate criminal legislation in the areas of fraud and of counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. (6) Recent years have brought not only an exponential increase in the digital economy, but also a proliferation of innovation in many areas, including payment technologies. New payment technologies involve the use of new types of payment instruments, which, while creating new opportunities for consumers and businesses, also increase opportunities for fraud. Consequently, the legal framework must remain relevant and up-to-date against the background of those technological developments, on the basis of a technology-neutral approach. (7) Fraud is not only used to fund criminal groups, but also limits the development of the digital single market and makes citizens more reluctant to make online purchases. (8) Common definitions in the areas of fraud and of counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment are important to ensure a consistent approach in Member States' application of this Directive and to facilitate information exchange and cooperation between competent authorities. The definitions should cover new types of non-cash payment instruments which allow for transfers of electronic money and virtual currencies. The definition of non-cash payment instruments should acknowledge that a non-cash payment instrument may consist of different elements acting together, for example a mobile payment application and a corresponding authorisation (e.g. a password). Where this Directive uses the concept of a non-cash payment instrument, it should be understood that the instrument puts the holder or user of the instrument in a position to actually enable a transfer of money or monetary value or to initiate a payment order. For example, unlawfully obtaining a mobile payment application without the necessary authorisation should not be considered as an unlawful obtainment of a non-cash payment instrument as it does not actually enable the user to transfer money or monetary value. (9) This Directive should apply to non-cash payment instruments only insofar as the instrument's payment function is concerned. (10) This Directive should cover virtual currencies only insofar as they can be commonly used for making payments. The Member States should be encouraged to ensure in their national law that future currencies of a virtual nature issued by their central banks or other public authorities will enjoy the same level of protection against fraudulent offences as non-cash means of payment in general. Digital wallets that allow the transfer of virtual currencies should be covered by this Directive to the same extent as non-cash payment instruments. The definition of the term digital means of exchange should acknowledge that digital wallets for transferring virtual currencies may provide, but do not necessarily provide, the features of a payment instrument and should not extend the definition of a payment instrument. (11) Sending fake invoices to obtain payment credentials should be considered as an attempt at unlawful appropriation within the scope of this Directive. (12) By using criminal law to give legal protection primarily to payment instruments that make use of special forms of protection against imitation or abuse, the intention is to encourage operators to provide such special forms of protection to payment instruments issued by them. (13) Effective and efficient criminal law measures are essential to protect non-cash means of payment against fraud and counterfeiting. In particular, a common criminal law approach is needed as regards the constituent elements of criminal conduct that contribute to or prepare the way for the actual fraudulent use of a non-cash means of payment. Conduct such as the collection and possession of payment instruments with the intention to commit fraud, through, for instance, phishing, skimming or directing or redirecting payment service users to imitation websites, and their distribution, for example by selling credit card information on the internet, should thus be made a criminal offence in its own right without requiring the actual fraudulent use of a non-cash means of payment. Such criminal conduct should therefore cover circumstances where possession, procurement or distribution does not necessarily lead to fraudulent use of such payment instruments. However, where this Directive criminalises possession or holding, it should not criminalise mere omission. This Directive should not sanction the legitimate use of a payment instrument, including and in relation to the provision of innovative payment services, such as services commonly developed by fintech companies. (14) With regard to the criminal offences referred to in this Directive, the concept of intent applies to all elements constituting those criminal offences in accordance with national law. It is possible for the intentional nature of an act, as well as any knowledge or purpose required as an element of an offence, to be inferred from objective, factual circumstances. Criminal offences which do not require intent should not be covered by this Directive. (15) This Directive refers to classical forms of conduct, like fraud, forgery, theft and unlawful appropriation that had already been shaped by national law before the era of digitalisation. The extended scope of this Directive with regard to non-corporeal payment instruments therefore requires the definition of equivalent forms of conduct in the digital sphere, complementing and reinforcing Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). The unlawful obtainment of a non-corporeal non-cash payment instrument should be a criminal offence, at least when it involves the commission of one of the offences referred to in Articles 3 to 6 of Directive 2013/40/EU or the misappropriation of a non-corporeal non-cash payment instrument. Misappropriation should be understood to mean the action of a person entrusted with a non-corporeal non-cash payment instrument, to knowingly use the instrument without the right to do so, to his own benefit or to the benefit of another. The procurement for fraudulent use of such an unlawfully obtained instrument should be punishable without it being necessary to establish all the factual elements of the unlawful obtainment and without requiring a prior or simultaneous conviction for the predicate offence which led to the unlawful obtainment. (16) This Directive also refers to tools which can be used in order to commit the offences referred to in it. Given the need to avoid criminalisation where such tools are produced and placed on the market for legitimate purposes and, though they could be used to commit criminal offences, are therefore not in themselves a threat, criminalisation should be limited to those tools which are primarily designed or specifically adapted for the purpose of committing the offences referred to in this Directive. (17) The sanctions and penalties for fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive throughout the Union. This Directive is without prejudice to the individualisation and application of penalties and execution of sentences in accordance with the circumstances of the case and the general rules of national criminal law. (18) As this Directive provides for minimum rules, Member States are free to adopt or maintain more stringent criminal law rules with regard to fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, including a broader definition of offences. (19) It is appropriate to provide for more severe penalties where a crime is committed in the framework of a criminal organisation, as defined in Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA (5). Member States should not be obliged to provide for specific aggravating circumstances where national law provides for separate criminal offences and this may lead to more severe sanctions. When an offence referred to in this Directive has been committed in conjunction with another offence referred to in this Directive by the same person, and one of those offences de facto constitutes a necessary element of the other, a Member State may, in accordance with general principles of national law, provide that such conduct is regarded as an aggravating circumstance to the main offence. (20) Jurisdictional rules should ensure that the offences referred to in this Directive are prosecuted effectively. In general, offences are best dealt with by the criminal justice system of the country in which they occur. Each Member State should therefore establish jurisdiction over offences committed on its territory and over offences committed by its nationals. Member States may also establish jurisdiction over offences that cause damage in their territory. They are strongly encouraged to do so. (21) Recalling the obligations under Council Framework Decision 2009/948/JHA (6) and Council Decision 2002/187/JHA (7), competent authorities are encouraged in cases of conflicts of jurisdiction to use the possibility of conducting direct consultations with the assistance of the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust). (22) Given the need for special tools to effectively investigate fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, and their relevance to effective international cooperation between national authorities, investigative tools that are typically used for cases involving organised crime or other serious crime should be available to competent authorities in all Member States, if and to the extent that the use of those tools is appropriate and commensurate with the nature and gravity of the offences as defined in national law. In addition, law enforcement authorities and other competent authorities should have timely access to relevant information in order to investigate and prosecute the offences referred to in this Directive. Member States are encouraged to allocate adequate human and financial resources to the competent authorities in order to properly investigate and prosecute the offences referred to in this Directive. (23) National authorities investigating or prosecuting offences referred to in this Directive should be empowered to cooperate with other national authorities within the same Member State and their counterparts in other Member States. (24) In many cases, criminal activities are behind incidents that should be notified to the relevant national competent authorities under Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). Such incidents may be suspected to be of a criminal nature even if there is insufficient evidence of a criminal offence at that stage. In such a context, relevant operators of essential services and digital service providers should be encouraged to share the reports required under Directive (EU) 2016/1148 with law enforcement authorities so as to form an effective and comprehensive response and to facilitate attribution and accountability by the perpetrators for their actions. In particular, promoting a safe, secure and more resilient environment requires systematic reporting of incidents of a suspected serious criminal nature to law enforcement authorities. Moreover, when relevant, computer security incident response teams designated under Directive (EU) 2016/1148 should be involved in law enforcement investigations with a view to providing information, as considered appropriate at national level, and also to providing specialist expertise on information systems. (25) Major security incidents as referred to in Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) may be of criminal origin. Where relevant, payment service providers should be encouraged to share with law enforcement authorities the reports they are required to submit to the competent authority in their home Member State under Directive (EU) 2015/2366. (26) A number of instruments and mechanisms exist at Union level to enable the exchange of information among national law enforcement authorities for the purposes of investigating and prosecuting crimes. To facilitate and speed up cooperation among national law enforcement authorities and make sure that those instruments and mechanisms are used to the fullest extent, this Directive should strengthen the importance of the operational points of contact introduced by Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA. It should be possible for Member States to decide to make use of the existing networks of operational points of contact, such as the one set up in Directive 2013/40/EU. The points of contact should provide effective assistance, for example by facilitating the exchange of relevant information and the provision of technical advice or legal information. To ensure the network runs smoothly, each point of contact should be able to communicate quickly with the point of contact in another Member State. Given the significant trans-border dimension of crimes covered by this Directive and in particular the volatile nature of electronic evidence, Member States should be able to deal promptly with urgent requests from the network and provide feedback within eight hours. In very urgent and serious cases, Member States should inform the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol). (27) Reporting crime to public authorities without undue delay is of great importance in combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, as it is often the starting point of criminal investigations. Measures should be taken to encourage reporting by natural and legal persons, in particular financial institutions, to law enforcement and judicial authorities. Those measures can be based on various types of action, including legislative acts containing obligations to report suspected fraud, or non-legislative actions, such as setting up or supporting organisations or mechanisms favouring the exchange of information, or awareness raising. Any such measure that involves processing of the personal data of natural persons should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). In particular, any transmission of information for the purposes of preventing and combating offences relating to fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment should comply with the requirements laid down in that Regulation, notably the lawful grounds for processing. (28) In order to facilitate the prompt and direct reporting of crime, the Commission should carefully assess the establishment of effective online fraud-reporting systems by Member States and standardised reporting templates at Union level. Such systems could facilitate the reporting of non-cash fraud which often takes place online, thereby strengthening support for victims, the identification and analysis of cybercrime threats and the work and cross-border cooperation of national competent authorities. (29) The offences referred to in this Directive often have a cross-border nature. Therefore, combating these offences relies on close cooperation between the Member States. Member States are encouraged to ensure, to the extent appropriate, effective application of mutual recognition and legal assistance instruments in relation to the offences covered by this Directive. (30) Investigation and prosecution of all types of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, including those involving small amounts of money, are particularly important in order to combat them effectively. Reporting obligations, information exchange and statistical reports are efficient ways to detect fraudulent activities, especially similar activities that involve small amounts of money when considered separately. (31) Fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment can result in serious economic and non-economic consequences for its victims. Where such fraud involves, for example, identity theft, its consequences are often aggravated because of reputational and professional damage, damage to an individual's credit rating and serious emotional harm. Member States should adopt assistance, support and protection measures aimed to mitigate those consequences. (32) Often a considerable amount of time can pass before victims find out that they have suffered a loss from fraud and counterfeiting offences. During that time a spiral of interlinked crimes might develop, thereby aggravating the negative consequences for the victims. (33) Natural persons who are victims of fraud related to non-cash means of payment have rights conferred under Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (11). Member States should adopt measures of assistance and support to such victims which build on the measures required by that Directive but respond more directly to the specific needs of victims of fraud related to identity theft. Such measures should include, in particular, the provision of a list of dedicated institutions covering different aspects of identity-related crime and victim support, specialised psychological support and advice on financial, practical and legal matters, as well as assistance in receiving available compensation. Member States should be encouraged to set up a single national online information tool to facilitate access to assistance and support for victims. Specific information and advice on protection against the negative consequences of such crime should be offered to legal persons as well. (34) This Directive should provide for the right for legal persons to access information in accordance with national law about the procedures for making complaints. This right is necessary in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and should contribute to creating a friendlier business environment for small and medium-sized enterprises. Natural persons already benefit from this right under Directive 2012/29/EU. (35) Member States should, with the assistance of the Commission, establish or strengthen policies to prevent fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment and measures to reduce the risk of such offences occurring by means of information and awareness-raising campaigns. In this context, Member States could develop and keep up to date a permanent online awareness-raising tool with practical examples of fraudulent practices, in a format that is easy to understand. That tool could be linked to or be part of the single national online information tool for victims. Member States could also put in place research and education programmes. Special attention should be paid to the needs and interests of vulnerable persons. Member States are encouraged to ensure that sufficient funding is made available for such campaigns. (36) It is necessary to collect statistical data on fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash payment instruments. Member States should therefore be obliged to ensure that an adequate system is in place for the recording, production and provision of existing statistical data on the offences referred to in this Directive. (37) This Directive aims to amend and expand the provisions of Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA. Since the amendments to be made are substantial in number and nature, Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA should, in the interests of clarity, be replaced in its entirety for the Member States bound by this Directive. (38) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and are not bound by it or subject to its application. (39) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to TEU and to TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive and is not bound by it or subject to its application. (40) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to subject fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment to effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties and to improve and encourage cross-border cooperation both between competent authorities and between natural and legal persons and competent authorities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of their scale or effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (41) This Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including the right to liberty and security, the respect for private and family life, the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and right of defence, the principles of the legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, as well as the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence. This Directive seeks to ensure full respect for those rights and principles and should be implemented accordingly, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: TITLE I SUBJECT MATTER AND DEFINITIONS Article 1 Subject matter This Directive establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the areas of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment.
